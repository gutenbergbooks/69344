<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>It has not been my purpose in writing this book to occupy
myself in expanding or discussing some articles written on
Greek criminal law in a learned dictionary of antiquities.
While it is true that ancient law, however crude and obscure
its expression, is not so repulsive, so inhumanly technical
as medieval or modern law, and while it is also true that a
writer on Greek blood-vengeance cannot avoid an occasional
reference to legal formulae and technique, nevertheless I
feel that a merely legal treatise would not advance the
prospects of Greek education or our knowledge of Greek
civilisation, for the simple reason that no one but a professed
student of ancient law could be induced to read it!</p>

<p>This work is intended rather as a supplement to the study
of Greek literature, history, and archaeology. The first part
contains an analysis of important elements of Homeric civilisation,
an account of the different strata in the Homeric society
and of the religious beliefs and practices of the Homeric Greeks.
This section owes much to the pioneer work of Ridgeway
and of Leaf; it carries, so to speak, into remote corners and
crevices the light which their genius has thrown on the general
nature and structure of early Greek society.</p>

<p>The second part is concerned with the Middle Age of
Hellenism (1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>): it is an attempt to explain
the social and religious evolution of the Hellenes and to
interpret the homicide laws of the historical period in the
light of that evolution. This section is inevitably the most
‘legal’ portion of the work, but an effort is made, even at
the cost of what might appear excessive repetition, to avoid
an unduly technical exposition, and the literary aspect of
the subject is constantly emphasised.</p>

<p>The third part is an enquiry into the origin and development
of the legends which are found in Attic tragedy. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
legends are permeated with references to homicide, and I
have attempted to render less obscure and difficult the
problems of blood-vengeance which they contain. As such
an attempt would be utterly impossible without a previous
discussion of the homicide laws of Greece, the account of
these laws which I have given in the second part of the work
should be regarded as a necessary preliminary to the subsequent
analysis of these legends.</p>

<p>The extent of my indebtedness to modern writers on this
and kindred subjects is sufficiently indicated in the footnotes
and the second section of the Index. I must, however, express,
in addition, my obligations to Professor Goligher, of Trinity
College, Dublin, for his kind encouragement, assistance, and
advice.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to my friend and colleague, Mr.
W. H. Porter, for his generous co-operation in reading and
correcting the proofs of this work and for his valuable criticisms
and suggestions. In particular, I owe to him the
alteration which I have adopted, on p. 195, in connection
with the restored Draconian inscription.</p>

<p>I should like also to record my appreciation of the accuracy
and efficiency of Messrs. Spottiswoode, Ballantyne &amp; Co.’s
Reader.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section I</span></h4>

<p>If we examine the various methods of blood-vengeance which
have been adopted by different peoples throughout the ages,
we shall find that they may be divided broadly into four groups
or categories. Amongst rude and savage races there exists
or has existed a system of vengeance which we may describe
as a barbarous and unrestricted vendetta. In the absence of
any social machinery for the determination of blood-guilt,
or for the estimation of its varying degrees, a single deed of
blood provokes an endless series of retaliations: a hideous
orgy of revenge rages through the land, an orgy which no
one may escape; for old men and women and children perish,
whether one by one, or in a general massacre. The vengeance
is at once collective and hereditary. It strikes at the neighbours
and at the most distant relatives of the murderer: it
strikes, too, at the children that are born when the murderer
has been gathered to his fathers. It ends only when there is
hardly anyone left to kill, or when a paltry sum of money is
offered to placate a glutted thirst for blood. It is a strange
fact that such a system should have survived up to comparatively
recent times<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the Balkan States. It is generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
but, as we hope to show, erroneously maintained that such a
system prevailed amongst the earliest inhabitants of Greece
about whom we have any certain knowledge.</p>

<p>A second mode of vengeance we may describe as a personal
restricted vendetta. It is distinguished from the mode which
we have just mentioned by the absence of collective or
hereditary punishment. It refuses to visit the sins of the
father upon his children or upon his neighbours. The right
to avenge remains with the relatives of the slain. They may
lie in wait for the slayer or, if he flees, they may dog his footsteps
over land and sea. But they dare not strike the innocent
for the guilty. There is some power, whether of military
autocracy, or of public opinion, which prescribes the bounds
of their avenging. The system does not generally include
a regular tribunal for the trial of homicide, whether because
there is little difficulty, in certain social groups, in determining
the identity of the murderer: or because some primitive
method of evidence, such as the ordeal of medieval Europe,
takes precedence of human witnesses: or because a recourse
to arbitration, in the private domain of a king or of a squire,
is too insignificant a procedure to have found its way into
any historical records. It is such a system that seems to
have prevailed in Serbia up to very recent times. It is such
a system that, we hope to show, existed amongst the Achaean
caste in Homeric Greece.</p>

<p>A third, and for our present purpose the most important,
mode of vengeance is that which we may describe as the ‘tribal
wergeld’ mode. It consists essentially of a compensation, in
the form of goods or valuables, which is paid by the relatives
of the slayer to the relatives of the slain. It differs from our
first-mentioned mode of vengeance in the fact that satisfaction
is paid in ‘money,’ not in blood, and in the fact that payment
is fixed by custom or law and is not of an indefinite duration.
It differs from the second mode in this, that the ideal penalty
is not death, but compensation or exile, and that the punishment
is collective rather than personal. The system is found
only in tribal communities, where the life of the individual
is subordinated to that of the group, and where property is
frequently possessed and enjoyed in common. It is, of course,
true that all tribal societies do not adopt this system, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
because temperament and environment foster a blood-lust
that money cannot appease, or because a religious law has
been superimposed upon the clans, or because a feudal or
highly centralised government has become strong enough to
resist the demands of the clansmen for compensation. But,
apart from these special circumstances, tribal communities
tend to adopt the ‘wergeld’ system of vengeance. We have
the most ample evidence<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of its operation in pre-medieval
Germany, and Wales, and Ireland and Scotland, amongst
the Anglo-Saxons, the Franks, the Wisigoths and the Vikings.
We can see in ancient Israel an instance of a land which has
evolved beyond the wergeld stage. There came a time
when a theocratic legislator was sufficiently powerful to
attack the privileges of the clans, and to cry out, as with a
divine voice, ‘Ye shall not take satisfaction for the life of a
man that is guilty of blood.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We hope to make it clear
that it was this system which prevailed amongst the earliest
inhabitants of Greek lands, who may, for convenience, be
described as Pelasgians. Owing to the great number of the
individuals who were liable to make or to receive compensation,
and also because of the social organisation of the tribes,
we are not surprised to find that a regular tribunal was frequently
appealed to, and that a trial, concerned more often
with the question of payment than with the question of
guilt, was one of the most common events of interest in
the life of Pelasgian tribesmen. No wonder is it then that
the poet Homer gives a description of such a scene<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
tells us that Hephaestus had engraved it on the famous Shield
of Achilles. This is the earliest reference to a trial of any kind
in all European literature.</p>

<p>Our fourth category of the modes of blood-vengeance is
intended to comprise all the methods of punishing homicide
which are characteristic of fully developed social organisms,
whether in ancient or in modern times. Homicide, which
was originally conceived as an outrage affecting only a family
or clan, may come to be regarded as a crime against the body
politic, as an insult to the majesty of the State, its laws,
its gods, or its governors. Indeed, this latter conception
usually becomes so vigorous that it obscures and ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
extinguishes the former, at least in so far as that former conception
concerns the claims of the relatives of the victim. In
early English law the word <i>murdrum</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> denoted a fine payable to
the king if the murderer was not produced. In feudalism,
the lord claimed a <i>portion</i> of the payment made by the relatives
of the slayer. This was the <i>honour-price</i>, an atonement for
the insult caused by a ‘breach of the peace.’ In historical<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Athens wergeld was forbidden, but the property of a convicted
murderer who went into perpetual exile was confiscated
to the State. In ancient Israel wergeld was abolished when
murder was conceived as a ‘sin’ against the God of the State,
when it was believed that blood polluted the land.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
Greece, too, we hope to show that wergeld was abolished in
the first instance by the religion of Apollo, and that the evolution
of the State, if it did not assist in its abolition, at least
ensured that the abolition should be permanent. Once murder
becomes a sin against the gods, or a crime against the State,
the day of private vengeance has passed: that of State trial,
State imprisonment, State execution takes its place. The
relatives may still assist, they may even be compelled to assist,
in the punishment of homicide, but they have lost the right to
material compensation.</p>

<p>We will now give a few illustrations of the actual operation
of these modes of blood-vengeance. As the fourth or last-mentioned
mode is found in all modern States, we need not
here illustrate its operation, especially as we shall have to
describe, at a later stage, the treatment of homicide in historical
Athens.</p>

<p>As an example of the practice of unrestricted vendetta, we
may cite the case of the Montenegrins.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This little people, up
to quite recent years, practised a collective and hereditary
vendetta, which continued from generation to generation, until
the number of victims on both sides was equal, or until a blood-price
of ten sequins was accepted by the feud-weary relatives of
the original victim. Again, in Sardinia,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> until the close of the
eighteenth century, a collective hereditary feud followed a
single act of murder, and hundreds of lives were lost in a single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
year. In Corsica,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in the eighteenth century, the vendetta-system
caused the loss of a thousand lives each year: whole
villages were depopulated: houses became fortresses where
armed men lay in wait, hungry for vengeance, while the women
tilled the fields. A similar barbarous blood-thirst was prevalent
in Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in Calabria,<a id="FNanchor_11b" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and in Albania,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> up to quite
recent times. The establishment of an improved system of
government and the operation of disciplinary penalties have
fortunately checked and must ultimately abolish so hideous a
mode of vengeance. These peoples of the Mediterranean area
are probably, as Ridgeway holds,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the racial descendants of
the old Pelagasian race. For this, and for other reasons, there
is a tendency to assume that the Pelasgians followed this
system of blood-vendetta. But we hope to show that this
view is probably incorrect, and that it is much more applicable
to the Greece of post-Achaean days, that is, from 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
to 750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> than to the Greece of Achaean and pre-Achaean
times.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the second mode of vengeance, we may
perhaps cite the Serbians of recent times who adopted a
restricted form of vendetta and who often allowed murder to
remain unpunished.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The restricted system seems to have
existed amongst the Araucanians<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of South America, and
amongst the Jivaros Indians,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but only when the identity of
the murderer could be established. In this latter case we
find the alternative operation of a more civilised with a more
barbarous form of vengeance. But we must not assume that
these forms coexist as alternatives everywhere. A French
authority holds<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that the essential motive of collective punishment
was the production or identification of the murderer. ‘So
long,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_17b" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> ‘as the murderer is unknown, so long is the
responsibility collective and diffused.’ We cannot accept this
statement as an explanation of the origin of unrestricted
vendetta. We admit that collective penalties of a minor
kind would form a strong inducement for the discovery of
the criminal. It was for this reason perhaps that an Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
law<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> levied a fine on the whole ‘hundred’ if the
murderer was not produced. But it is one thing to bring
pressure to bear on a district, whether by a fine, as in this
case, or by an oath, as in the instance mentioned in Deuteronomy<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>;
it is quite another thing to destroy a whole town
or village if the murderer was unknown. We shall see<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
that the Homeric Achaeans often waited long for vengeance,
and often allowed the homicide to go unpunished, rather than
visit with unjust punishment the innocent relatives of the slayer.
In this system there is no trace of collectivity. The relatives
have not even to pay a sum of money. The flight of the slayer
is not indeed accepted as a substitute for the normal penalty,
which is death, but it postpones indefinitely, if not for ever, a
vengeance which the slayer alone can suffer.</p>

<p>To illustrate the operation of the ‘tribal wergeld’ system,
we naturally turn, in the first place, to the Germans of pre-Christian
days. Tacitus says<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of them: ‘It is an indispensable
duty to adopt the private enmities of a father or a relative
... these, however, are not irreconcilable and perpetual.
Even homicide is atoned for by a fixed number of cattle and
sheep and the whole House accepts the satisfaction, to the
benefit of the civic group.’ Tacitus is obviously astonished
at this system of compensation for homicide. The Romans,
like the Germans, were familiar with the organisation of the
clan, and of the tribe, but Roman law, as far back as we can
trace it, did not permit wergeld. In Rome,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> from 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
onwards, the expiation of the insult which the homicide offered
to the State and its gods had driven from view, and had
therefore probably abolished, the material compensation of the
clan. The chief detail of interest which Tacitus gives us is
the collective acceptance of satisfaction by a whole House or
Family. From other sources, which we shall presently discuss,
we may infer that the House in this instance was a very large
unit, including not merely the closer kindred which traced
descent to a common living (or lately deceased) ancestor,
but that wider group of kinsmen which is called the clan.</p>

<p>We note also, in Tacitus’ account, a reference to a fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
number of cattle and sheep. Who was it that fixed the
number? Who was it that paid? To answer these questions
we shall cite some details of Welsh wergeld payments which
have been admirably collected and explained by Mr. F. Seebohm.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the Cymric codes, the normal wergeld was a payment
of one hundred and twenty cows, but the number varied
according to the rank of the slain. For the death of a chieftain
the amount was one hundred and eighty cows: for the death
of a stranger, from thirty to sixty cows.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Over and above
the wergeld or <i>galanas</i>, there was payable an insult-price or
<i>saraad</i>, consisting of six cows. This amount was always paid
first, from the murderer’s own cattle. Within fourteen days
of the murder, a meeting of the slayer’s clan or wider kindred
was convened, at which the proportion of wergeld due
from each family was determined. Usually the murderer’s
family paid forty cows, or one-third of the total wergeld. Of
this amount the murderer himself paid one-third, or about
fourteen cows; his father and mother paid one-third, and his
brothers and sisters one-third, the brothers paying twice as
much as the sisters. The remaining portion of the wergeld,
namely, eighty cows, was paid by the wider kindred. Relatives
on the paternal side paid two-thirds, those on the maternal
side, one-third. As the clan comprised very often a large
number of people, the actual contribution of individual cousins
of the murderer would have been rather small. The murderer
himself paid, in <i>saraad</i> and <i>galanas</i>, a total forfeit of twenty
cows. But if the murderer was poor, there was paid ‘spear-penny,’
which was one-ninth of the wergeld, but was collected
from male kinsmen on the paternal side.</p>

<p>It was not necessary that these payments should all be
made at the same time, or immediately. They were frequently
made in fortnightly instalments. The system of receiving
wergeld seems to have been parallel. It is probable that
the cows paid by the murderer’s family went to the family
of the victim: those paid by first cousins went to first cousins:
those paid by paternal kindred went to paternal kindred: all
being distributed in the last resort to individuals, if the clans
involved had developed the principle of individual ownership<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
at that particular period of time. It is clear from the Cymric
codes that individual ownership was assumed as universally
prevalent. But it is certain that such a condition is not a
characteristic of all tribal communities. In the Salic law,
which operated amongst the Germans from about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 500
onwards, a distinction was made between the inheritance of
‘wergeld’ and that of the ‘allod’ or family-domain.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> While
the latter could only be inherited by a family group which did
not extend beyond second cousins, a group which in Wales
was called a ‘gwely,’ the wergeld was inherited by all persons
who could trace any kind of direct descent, however remote,
from a common ancestor of the original receivers of the
wergeld. This law seems to us to reflect an ancient system
of communistic ownership in movable property amongst the
Germans. Indeed we may infer the existence of such a
system from the account which Caesar<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> gives of the pre-Christian
Germans. Even in the time of Tacitus the arable
land of the Germans had not yet become private property.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It is in this common control, or common ownership, of
wergeld that we may find the explanation of the absence
of wergeld-payments for homicide within the clan. Seebohm,
speaking of the Welsh system, says<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>: ‘A murder within
this wider kindred was regarded as a family matter....
There was no blood-fine or <i>galanas</i> within the kindred.’ We
shall find at least one illustration of this important principle
in the <i>Iliad</i> of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It is not a complete explanation
of the principle to assert, as Fustel de Coulanges would assert,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
that the kin-slayer had offended his domestic gods and that
no payment could permit the continued presence of the
murderer at the ancestral hearth fire in which the life of a
kinsman had been violently submerged. In the phratry
different clans had a common worship, and the murderer
who paid wergeld joined in that worship. We agree with
Coulanges that the attitude of the domestic gods towards kin-slaying
differed from that of the phratry-gods towards ordinary
homicide. But why? Because primitive man creates gods
in his own image and endows them with his own emotions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
It is with man, not with gods, that the ultimate explanation
lies. The real explanation of the principle is to be found,
we think, in a tradition ultimately resting on the common
ownership of property.</p>

<p>Accepting this principle, we can understand more easily the
punishment of kin-murder in tribal society. There are only
three alternative penalties to wergeld: exile, bondage (or
servitude) and death. It is natural to assume, and it has been
rightly maintained,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that death was a loathsome penalty in
days when relatives alone could avenge. It was therefore
rarely, if ever, exacted. Bondage or servitude also, though
sometimes found as a punishment for homicide,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> would naturally
be avoided as a sequel to kin-murder. There remains only the
option of exile. Like Cain, the slayer of his brother, the kin-murderer
must wander over the wide earth.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Expelled from
his clan, his home, his property and his gods, he goes forth to
slavery or to death in other lands. As a French writer puts
it, ‘Alone, he has arrayed against him the universe.’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>When homicide occurred between members of different
clans, death was never inflicted on the slayer, except in the
last resort. It was, perhaps, in order to avoid this fate, that
the slayer sometimes fled into exile. But it is doubtful if
his flight cancelled any part of the wergeld except his own
individual share, or the ‘spear-penny’ which he was expected
to collect, if he was poor. It is certain however that the
life of the slayer was never exposed to danger from the relatives
of the victim so long as he remained in exile. That there were
variations in the matter of accepting exile as part-payment
of wergeld will be obvious from the following facts which
we cite also as illustrations of the survival of wergeld in a
modified form under feudal or ecclesiastical rule.</p>

<p>In the <i>Canones Wallici</i>, a code of laws which operated in
Wales in the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, we find<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that the slayer
pays half the total wergeld, and his relatives pay half. The
wergeld at this time consisted of three male slaves and three
female slaves: if the slayer went into exile his half was cancelled,
but his relatives had still to pay their half, or to follow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
him into exile. In the Burgundian homicide-laws of the
fifth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> we find<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that the penalty for the murder
of a freeman was death. The older wergeld penalty, which
was now abolished for murder, was however retained in a
certain form for minor degrees of guilt. Thus, for manslaughter,
we have a list of blood-ransoms arranged according
to the rank of the victim: for the unintentional slaying of a
noble, the penalty was a payment of 300 solidi: for that of
an ordinary man, 200 solidi, and so on. For slaying a person
in self-defence, the penalty was reduced to one-half in each
case. Amongst the laws of the early Norman Kings of England
we find<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the following, attributed to Henry I, in which a
group of neighbours known as guild-brethren (<i>congildones</i>)
are compelled to supplement the payments of the kindred.
‘If anyone commit homicide of this kind, let his relatives pay as
much wergeld as they would have received if he (the slayer)
had been killed: if the slayer have relatives on the father’s
side and not on the mother’s, they pay as much as they would
have received, that is, two-thirds the wergeld: if the slayer
has only maternal relatives, they pay one-third the wergeld,
the <i>congildones</i> one-third, and himself one-third: if he has no
maternal relatives, the <i>congildones</i> pay half, and himself half.’
The manner in which feudalism gradually substituted the
conception of murder as an insult to a king or to a lord for
the older conception of it as an injury to the clan is clearly
seen in the following law<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> attributed to King Henry I: ‘If
the slain man has no kindred ... half shall be paid to the
king, and half to the <i>congildones</i> (of the victim).’ In one
portion of the Salic law we read<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that if anyone slays a kinsman
and goes into exile, his goods are confiscated to the royal
treasury. Feudalism has thus exacted a new penalty which
the clan-regime did not exact.</p>

<p>On the other hand we find a diminution in the collective
punishment which tribal wergeld carried with it, in the
law of King Edmund (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 940-946) which may thus be
rendered in modern English<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>: ‘If anyone henceforth slay
any man, (I will) that he himself bear the feud unless with
the aid of his friends he compensate it with full wergeld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
within twelve months. But if they will not pay, I will that
all the kindred be free from the feud except the murderer,
provided they do not afterwards give him food and protection.’
In such laws as these we catch a glimpse of a system
of blood-vengeance which once prevailed amongst tribal
peoples, but which soon became a mere echo, a phantom
shadow of its former self, in the march of mightier movements,
in the onward course of civilisation.</p>

<p>We have wandered far afield in the search for definite
details of the wergeld system, as we shall look in vain for
such details in the ancient literature of Greece, though we
can have no doubt that the system prevailed in Greece for
many centuries. It is true that in the laws of Gortyn we
find<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a classification of money-payments which were exacted
for adultery and seduction at a period which no authority
regards as earlier than the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and which
is generally believed<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to be the sixth or fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
These payments varied according to the rank of the offender
and of the injured party: and also according to the particular
circumstances of the offence.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But at the time of the Gortyn
laws, Crete had passed out of the stage in which murder was
materially compensated. Hence these laws contain no reference
to the wergeld system. We must therefore be content
to apply to the earliest societies of Greek lands the general
principles of the payment of wergeld which we find operative
in other tribal countries. We have in the text of Homer
unmistakable evidence<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> for the payment of some form of
wergeld. The only question that arises is: was this payment
a mere sordid termination of a sanguinary feud, such as
characterised the Montenegrins up to recent years, or was it
a genuine tribal wergeld? Before attempting to answer
this question, it will be necessary to examine briefly the nature
of the societies which existed in Homeric Greece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section II</span></h4>

<p>Fortunately, as a result of recent archaeological exploration
we are now entitled to assume, what the ancient Greeks
so naturally believed, that the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, the
pioneer epics of European literature, are valuable historical
documents for the period which preceded and followed the
Trojan war. For our present purpose it does not very much
matter whether the poems were composed by one great poet
or by a number of rhapsodists, whether they were composed
in Greece or in Asia Minor. The important thing is that
they refer to actual places and events, to men and women
who really lived and died. Just as Seebohm accepts the
poem <i>Beowulf</i> as sole evidence for early Scandinavian tribal
custom, even though he describes<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the poem as an ‘Anglian
or Northumbrian recension of a story founded on Scandinavian
tradition and designed for recital at some eighth-century
royal court,’ so we see in the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> a genuine
historical picture of Greece under the Achaean domination,
even though these poems were not the work of contemporary
hands, and contain certain passages and verses<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which are
clearly of later origin than that of the poems as a whole. It
is only necessary for us here to refer to two recent works<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
of Dr. Leaf which furnish a cogent justification for this
assumption. Professor Ridgeway, too, who has done so much
to remove the veil of obscurity which has hung for so long
over early Greece, has never wavered in his belief<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in the
historicity of Homer. We should indeed prefer to be wrong
with Leaf and Ridgeway rather than to be right with such
critics as Gilbert Murray<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and Miss Harrison,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who see in the
Homeric poems the culmination of centuries of literary work,
which took final form and shape in the Athens of Solon and
Peisistratus, in the atmosphere of the Persian rather than
the Trojan war.</p>

<p>The <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, however, if they are to be
correctly interpreted, must be studied in the light of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
sociological analogy and archaeological research. Everyone
is now familiar with the differentiation which the learning
and genius of Ridgeway first defined in the population of
early Greece, and with the distinction which he has indicated
between the <i>Achaeans</i> and the <i>Pelasgians</i>.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In Homer, the
peoples of Greece are called <i>Achaeans</i>: but Ridgeway holds
that the Achaeans were not Greeks: that they were not even
members of any Mediterranean race; that they were Celts<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
from Central Europe who descended slowly into Greece, who
conquered the inhabitants by virtue of superiority in the arts
and weapons of war, who settled and intermarried with native
royal families, and who, in the course of two hundred years,
had become assimilated to the natives in language and culture,
until they lost all consciousness of difference.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Homer, the
poet of the Achaeans, called the Greek-Achaean host, the mixed
army of Pelasgians and Achaeans, by a name which belonged
only to the Celtic kings in whose courts he sang his songs of
praise. The Celtic Achaeans have lost their language but retained
their name. The Pelasgians, according to Ridgeway,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
spoke in the time of Homer an Aryan tongue so well that
even their conquerors came to speak it and forgot their own.
Yet they were not, in origin, an Aryan race! On this point we
find it difficult to agree with Ridgeway, though we admire the
scientific reasoning and the profound learning which support
his theory. The precise nature of the social organisations of
early Greece, Ridgeway does not attempt to decide—at least
in his ‘Early Age of Greece’: but we infer from an article
which he has written on Homeric land-tenure<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> that he
believed, as does Mr. H. Seebohm,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that both Achaeans and
Pelasgians were tribal peoples.</p>

<p>Some of the difficulties presented by Ridgeway’s reasoning
are removed, in our opinion, by the more recent theories of
Dr. Leaf. Before the advent of the Achaeans to Greece about
1400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> there already existed in Greece, according to
Leaf, two social and racial strata: (1) a dominant non-Aryan<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
caste who came originally from Crete, and who may be called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Minoans: (2) a primitive neolithic agricultural Aryan people
who spoke Greek,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> who were, in fact, the nucleus of the Greek
race, and who had imposed their speech upon their non-Aryan
masters. The Achaeans, in Leaf’s view, came as a wave or
series of waves in the perpetual tide of invasion from the
north.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Settling first in Epirus,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> they pressed gradually
southwards, subdued the Minyans (or Minoans) of Iolcos,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
and the Pelasgians of central Greece,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> crossed later to the
Peloponnese, and having conquered Elis, Laconia and Argolis,
established themselves in all the strategic positions of the
peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> They were not necessarily, in Leaf’s opinion,
of different racial origin from the Pelasgians<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>: they may,
in fact, have been remotely related to them. But the Achaean
outlook and temperament were very different from those of
the Pelasgian folk. The former were military freebooters;
piratical adventurers,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> bound together by that rigid obedience
to a single commander which was an essential condition of
their survival and success. The latter were tillers of the
soil, accustomed to political serfdom,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> paying such dues as
their masters exacted, following them, on occasion, to battle
and to death. One point of difference which Leaf mentions
must be here especially emphasised, as it is of vital importance
for our theory of Homeric blood-vengeance. The Achaeans,
Leaf holds,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> had no tribal or ‘kindred’ organisations, and
were merely soldiers of a common army. The Pelasgians,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
however, were for the most part organised on the model of
tribal communities. Speaking of the Achaeans, he says<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>:
‘All the rites and taboos of the primitive Family-system have
disappeared and obligation only attaches to the natural kinship
of close blood-relationship.... This is what we should
expect in a race of military adventurers. Family rites do
not tend to military efficiency: the efficient soldier must break
away from local ties. In so doing he takes a long step away
from the foundations of primitive society and religion.’ Thus
Leaf conceives the society of Homeric Greece as composed
of two elements: (1) a military autocracy, ruling like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Spartans in Laconia, a small exclusive caste held together
by the consciousness of a common origin and a common purpose
and also by the danger of hostility from without: (2) a tribal
agricultural subject-folk who lived their primitive lives in
rural areas, in villages, in unimportant towns, and even in
cities within view of the Achaean garrison. Now this conception
differs fundamentally from the traditional ideas of
Homeric society, and in particular from the conception of the
Achaeans as a tribal people, which we have associated with
Ridgeway and H. Seebohm. We believe that an attempt
to decide this question is necessary for the elucidation of many
Homeric problems, such as that of blood-vengeance or of
land-tenure. We shall adduce evidence, in our study of
Homeric blood-vengeance, which will serve as a confirmation
of Leaf’s hypothesis. At present we will confine ourselves to
some more general arguments which can be regarded as
supplementary to the evidence which Leaf himself puts
forward.</p>

<p>Ridgeway, in discussing<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> the mode of land-tenure in
Homeric Greece, seeks to prove that the Homeric poems
reveal an evolution in the private ownership of land, beginning
with a stage in which, as in the <i>Iliad</i>, land is held in common
by all tribesmen except the king or chief whose <i>temenos</i> is
private and personal and probably hereditary, and progressing
to a stage in which, as in the <i>Odyssey</i>, ‘allotments’ among
tribesmen tend to accumulate and to become more and more
a family inheritance within the tribe, without attaining to
the stage of absolutely private ownership which we find in
the time of Hesiod. Such an evolution is, of course, a
characteristic feature of settled tribal existence. Sir Henry
Maine, in his interesting analysis<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of the origin of private
property in land, distinguishes three stages of its growth.
In the first stage, there is communal ownership, both of land
and harvest, such as is still found among some Highland
clans of Scotland: the food-supplies of individuals are doled
out, sometimes daily, by the chiefs of the clans.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The
periodical distribution of the ‘harvest,’ such as was made
by the elders of tribal Slavonic subjects in the once mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Austrian and Turkish Empires, marks a slight modification
of this system, which does not, however, affect the tenure of
land.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> ‘In the Russian villages, however,’ says Maine,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
‘the substance of the property ceases to be looked upon as
indivisible, and separate proprietary claims are allowed freely
to grow up.... After the expiration of a given, but not in
all cases of the same, period, separate ownerships are
extinguished, the land of the village is thrown into a mass:
and then it is redistributed among the families composing the
community, according to their number.’ The third stage
finds an illustration in India, where, as Maine says,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> ‘not
only is there no indivisibility of the common fund, but separate
proprietorship in parts of it may be indefinitely prolonged and
may branch out into any number of derivative ownerships,
the <i>de facto</i> partition of the stock being, however, checked by
inveterate usage and by the rule against the admission of
strangers without the consent of the brotherhood.’ Though
neither Maine nor Ridgeway mentions the analogy, we think
we can trace some such evolution in the old German tribes
as described by Caesar and by Tacitus. Caesar tells us<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> that
here ‘no one has a fixed portion of land, his own peculiar
property, but the magistrates and chiefs allot every year to
<i>tribes and clans</i> as much land as, and in whatever place, they
think proper, and they oblige them to remove the succeeding
year.’ Tacitus, however, says<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that ‘the lands are occupied
by villages, in groups, in allotments proportioned to the number
of cultivators, and are presently parcelled out among <i>individuals</i>
according to rank and condition: the arable lands are annually
changed.’</p>

<p>Such a theory of evolution in landed property within the
tribe may, however, be complicated by the coexistence, in
the same district, of tribal groups and of a dominant ‘feudal’
caste. Maine points out,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in reference to Russian village-communities,
that ‘these villages are always in theory the
patrimony of some noble proprietor, and the peasants have
within historical times been converted into the predial and,
to a great extent, into the personal serfs, of the seignior. But
the pressure of this superior ownership has never crushed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
ancient organisation of the village.’ Now if we adopt the
hypothesis of two distinct strata in the Homeric society,
namely, of a dominant quasi-feudal Achaean caste, and of a
tribal Pelasgian subject-folk, we shall be justified in assuming
that some such ‘superior ownership’ coexisted with tribal
ownership in the world of the Homeric poems. We shall
expect to find a predominance of private ownership on the
one hand, and a trace or ‘reminiscence’ of communal ownership
on the other, in the verses of a poet who reflected in the
main the atmosphere of the Achaean lords, but also, incidentally
and fortuitously, that of the subject people. We must, then,
consult the text of Homer if we hope to decide whether the
Achaeans were quasi-feudal adventurers who ruled over the
Pelasgians, without disturbing or destroying their normal
tribal life: or whether the Achaeans, themselves a tribal
nomadic people, adopted, by a social fusion, the tribal ownership
which existed amongst their subjects, the chiefs alone
possessing ‘private land,’ the others, common land. As the
Homeric references to land-tenure are rare and obscure, it
is obvious that the solution of the problem of Homeric land-ownership
depends entirely on the answer to this wider and
more important question.</p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i> xii. 422-426 Homer makes use of a simile derived
from a current mode of tenure of arable land, in order to
describe the fierceness of the conflict between the Argives
and the Lycians. ‘As, in a common field, two men make
quarrel over boundaries, with measures in their hands, and
strive for equal rights, even inch by inch, so, too, were they
(the Argives and the Lycians) by (the brief space of) the battlements
divided.’ This passage proves beyond question that
the poet and his hearers were familiar with a certain degree
of communism in the use of arable land. Whether the reference
is to a social condition in which, as in the German tribes
at the time of Tacitus, the arable land was redistributed
annually to individuals, or whether the land was redistributed
after long intervals of undisturbed enjoyment, as was the
custom in certain Russian villages, it is impossible, as it is
unnecessary, to decide. The really important point which
we wish to emphasise is that there is no evidence that the
quarrelsome tillers of the soil were Achaeans. This passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
does not prove that the Achaeans lived in clans and tribes and
possessed their lands in communal fashion. It merely proves
that they were familiar with the existence of such a mode of
possession. Incidentally, also, it proves how strong and how
passionate, even in tribal rustic folk, the instinct begotten of
even temporary private ownership may be. Yet this is the
principal text of Homer upon which has been based the theory
of the tribal nature of Homeric society!</p>

<p>In <i>Odyssey</i> vi. 6-10 we are told how Nausithous, the
Phaeacian, brought his people to Scheria, ‘and drew a wall
around the town and builded houses, and made temples for
the gods, and meted out the fields.’ Here we may observe
that elaborate ceremonial which, as Fustel de Coulanges points
out,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> was characteristic of the foundation of cities or of
settlements in Ancient Greece and Rome. The distribution
of land was an essential condition of agricultural existence for
tribes which had already developed a certain degree of private
ownership. But this passage merely proves that groups of
people were known to change their habitations.</p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i> vi. 190-195 we learn that a king of Lycia gave
to Bellerophon, as a dowry for his wife, half his valuables
(τιμή), and the Lycians gave him a domain (τέμενος) superior
to that of others. Ridgeway and H. Seebohm maintain that
the only land which is held in private ownership, in the <i>Iliad</i>,
is the domain of kings and princes. In this passage we admit
the probable operation of tribal ownership, but we must point
out that the Lycians were not Achaeans. A more relevant
citation is <i>Iliad</i> ix. 574-84, a passage in which we are told that
the Elders and Priests of the Aetolians offered a choice of
their richest lands as a ‘domain’ to Meleager. H. Seebohm
holds<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that it is improbable that the richest lands were at
the time unoccupied and that such an offer therefore proves
the existence of a communal land-tenure which would admit
of such a rapid partition and consequent readjustment. Again,
we admit that tribal ownership may be inferred from this
passage, but we deny that the donors of the domain were
necessarily members of the Achaean caste. It is true that
the Achaeans ruled over Aetolia, but there still survived many
rich Pelasgian tribes. Even if we knew that the donors were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Achaeans, it would not be necessary to conclude that the
Achaeans lived in tribal groups, for the partition and readjustment
might have been equally simple for rich quasi-feudal
owners acting in unison.</p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i> ix. 147-155 Agamemnon, the Achaean war-chief,
says that he will give to Achilles, as a dowry with his daughter,
‘seven cities, around Pylos, having men abounding in flocks
who will worship him with gifts as a god and obey him.’ Those
who conceive the Achaean heroes as tribal chieftains will find
it very difficult to explain how a chief can thus wantonly
confiscate the territory of his allies. Pylos was in the
‘kingdom’ of Nestor, a Minoan ally of the Achaeans. No
confederation of tribal chiefs engaged in a common war could
survive such a confiscation. But the offer of Agamemnon
becomes intelligible enough if we regard him as the leader
of a dominant military power, or as the feudal over-lord who
possessed by right of office a ‘superior ownership’ of all the
lands of Greece.</p>

<p>In <i>Odyssey</i> iv. 171-177 Menelaus says that he would have
given to Odysseus, had he been there on his return from Troy,
a whole ‘city to dwell in,’ and that he would have built for
him a house, and brought him from Ithaca, together with all
his wealth, his son and all his people, ‘making one city desolate,
of those that lay around, in his domain.’ H. Seebohm finds
it difficult to understand this passage in the light of his tribal
theory of the Achaeans. It is, he says,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> unusual, and merely
shows the despotism to which a tribal chief frequently attained.
But we prefer to see in Menelaus the typical Achaean over-lord,
who by virtue of his kinship with Agamemnon, and of
his own feudal and military power, tramples with impunity
upon a whole city and moves a whole people from place to
place, not as a chief would lead his tribe, but as a medieval
baron might move his <i>villeins</i> from one part of his territory to
another.</p>

<p>In the realm of Odysseus one seeks in vain for cogent
evidence of tribal conditions. The shameless conduct of the
suitors of Penelope, in devouring the substance of the absent
Odysseus, and in plotting the assassination of his son and
heir,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> as also the cruel hyper-vengeance which Odysseus with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
impunity wreaked upon them, seem to us more suggestive of
feudalism and autocracy than of genuine tribalism. In tribal
communities an immense importance attaches to questions of
marriage and inheritance. The voice of the ‘folk-moot,’ of
the clan-gathering, can and must be heard. It is true that in
the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> the disguised Odysseus, in questioning his son
as to why he had not driven the suitors from his house, asks
significantly: ‘Do the people hate thee?’ But it is equally
true that in the domestic drama of the realm of Odysseus the
rank and file of the people are ignored. For our part we feel
that we move in that atmosphere of autocratic militarism
which, in ancient Thessaly or Macedonia, and in medieval
Europe, exalts the dagger of the assassin and the intrigue of the
paramour.</p>

<p>In <i>Odyssey</i> xiv. 208 we are told that when a certain rich
man, named Castor, died, his sons divided up and cast lots for
his property. This procedure would be perfectly normal in
modern society if the owner died intestate and the property
was not entailed. We hear nothing in this narration of any
clan-council having determined the right of succession, as
would ordinarily occur in tribal conditions.</p>

<p>In <i>Odyssey</i> xix. 294 it is said that the wealth which Odysseus
has amassed would suffice for his posterity even unto the tenth
generation. The selection of the number <i>ten</i> in this passage
seems to us to indicate a possible reference to tribal life.
F. Seebohm, speaking of medieval Welsh tribes, lays stress
on the length of time which had to elapse before a ‘stranger’
could become a tribesman, pointing out<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> that even the great-grandson
of a stranger could not be a tribesman, though he
could be recognised as the founder of an embryonic clan,
whereas a semi-servile stranger’s descendants could not attain
to the rank of tribesmen until the ninth generation had
passed away. Hence the saying that a man’s wealth would
suffice for ten generations could easily, in tribal language, have
become a proverb. It would simply mean that a man’s posterity
would never be in want, for after nine generations any
man’s descendants could have formed a tribal organisation and
possessed tribal wealth of their own. But must we conclude
from this that Odysseus was a tribesman? No conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
could be less cogent. It is true that the Achaeans, at the time
of the Trojan war, were long enough settled in the country to
have produced the nucleus of clans and tribes, for they had
ruled over Greece for two hundred years. Thus the Achaean
Melampus, a contemporary of Nestor and Atreus, founded a
family in Argos, the development of which may thus be traced
in Homer<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>:</p>

<table class="nw">
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4" class="valign">Melampus—&gt;</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">{ Antiphates—</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">Oicles——Amphiaraus—</td>
    <td>{ Alcmaeon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{ Amphilochus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">{ Mantius—</td>
    <td>{ Polypheides—Theoclymenus.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{ Cleitus.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Here we find kinship extending to second and third cousins.
Such kinship exists everywhere in the world to-day, but it
clearly does not constitute a clan or a tribe. When, therefore,
in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Theoclymenus is said to have killed a man who is
described as ἔμφυλος in relation to his slayer, we must not
suppose that the deceased was a tribesman. The word ἔμφυλος
should be translated as kinsman,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> not tribesman. Several
instances may be found in Homer of tribal phrases and
expressions applied in non-tribal contexts. Thus the word
γένος which ordinarily means ‘clan’ is used in Homer to
denote a family in the modern sense,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> or to mean ‘blood-descent,’
and kinship.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Rarely or never does it carry its
proper meaning. If the social organisation of the Achaeans
had been of a tribal character, surely the Homeric use
of the word γένος would have been different from what it
actually is. Leaf calls attention<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> to the very rare occasions
on which Homer refers to such groups as the clan, the
phratry, and the tribe. Nestor says to Achilles that ‘the
lover of domestic strife is a man without hearth or law or
phratry,’<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and the same Nestor urges Agamemnon to divide
his fighting forces ‘by tribes and phratries,’<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> but these solitary
references no more compel us to regard Achilles and Agamemnon
as tribal chiefs than the tribal proverb concerning the tenth
generation compels us to regard Odysseus as a tribal patriarch.
Such references are rather, as Leaf says,<a id="FNanchor_91b" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> ‘reminiscences,’
reflections, whether in the mind of a Minoan or of an Achaean,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of conditions which prevailed universally amongst the subject
Pelasgian peoples.</p>

<p>We may then confidently conclude that the evidence of
the Homeric poems is much more consistent with the theory
that the Achaeans were a quasi-feudal military caste than with
the theory which conceives them as tribal nobles. We may
think of the Achaeans, in their relation to the Pelasgians, very
much as we should think of the soldiers of the ancient Roman
Empire quartered in a province.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> When the Burgundians
came to France about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 500 they were regarded,<a id="FNanchor_94b" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> by a polite
fiction, as guests, and were presented with <i>hospitalitas</i>, consisting
of two-thirds of the land and one-third of the slaves! When
the Achaeans conquered Greece, they lived, indeed, in garrison-towns
and sought to maintain a splendid isolation in their lofty
fortresses, but they took unto themselves the richest lands and
the fattest cattle and sheep, leaving the Pelasgians to till the
soil and to squabble about boundaries. But when after two
or three hundred years the Achaeans met a somewhat similar
fate to that which they had meted out to Greece and to Troy,
the tribal nobility of the primitive Pelasgians once more
asserted its ancient privileges.</p>

<p>Current views explained and criticised: author’s view: proofs from the text
of Homer: question of a distinction between murder and manslaughter,
and between justifiable and unjustifiable homicide: collectivity in
vengeance.</p>

</div>

<p>The opinions which have hitherto prevailed among scholars
in regard to early Greek blood-vengeance are more or less
unanimous. They seem to be based on an assumption of homogeneity
in the society depicted by Homer. Expressed in terms
of the modes of vengeance which we have described in the preceding
chapter, the customs of Homeric Greeks in regard to
homicide have been conceived as a confusion of modes I, II, and
III—as a mixture of restricted and unrestricted vendetta and
wergeld. Thus, Eichhoff<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> holds that in Homer murder is a
‘private’ affair, and that the slayer must go into exile if the
‘money’ paid to the injured family is not accepted. Bury<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
says: ‘According to early custom which we find reflected
in Homer, murder and manslaughter were not regarded as
crimes against the State, but concerned exclusively the family
of the slain man, which might either slay the slayer or accept
compensation.’ Grote<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> says: ‘That which the murderer in
Homeric times had to dread was not public prosecution and
punishment, but the personal vengeance of the kinsmen and
friends of deceased. To escape from this danger he is obliged
to flee the country, unless he can prevail upon the incensed
kinsmen to accept of a valuable payment as satisfaction for
their slain comrade.’ Jevons<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> says: ‘If the family of the
murderer were not content to pay the wergeld, the murderer
generally found it expedient to flee into a far country, for, if
he remained he would assuredly be killed in revenge.’ In a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
foot-note in Butcher and Lang’s translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
we are told that ‘as a rule blood called for blood, and the
manslayer had to flee from the kindred who took up the feud....
It is superfluous to remark that the “price” as an alternative
to vengeance is a widespread custom.’ Glotz<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> speaks of
death, exile, wergeld, and slavery as possible penalties everywhere.
He seems to believe that there existed in Homeric times
that collective and hereditary vengeance which is so characteristic
of barbarous peoples, but for this view he has adduced no
evidence apart from post-Homeric legends. In an article in
Daremberg and Saglio’s <i>Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques
et Romaines</i>,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> we are informed that ‘originally’ homicide is
an offence only against the family of the victim, and all the
members of the ‘famille outragée’ have a right and a duty
of vengeance. To escape this vengeance the murderer has no
other resource but exile. His exile will exempt his kinsmen
from the reprisals to which they would otherwise be exposed.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
As the murderer will be most often supported and defended
by his family, a war of families will lay desolate a whole
country: in course of time, and with the softening of
human character, the offended family will renounce its
vengeance, and enter into a bargain with the murderer and
his family. He will be permitted to return from exile, but,
as a rule, only by payment of ‘compensation.’ His relatives
will furnish him with this payment (ποινή), at once the price
of the blood shed and the ransom of the murderer’s life.
The payment is vaguely defined at first, varying with the
importance and the wealth of families. For murder within
the family (γένος), there is no question of wergeld. A compromise
is effected by which the family waive their right to
kill the murderer on condition that he leaves the γένος—‘ils se
bornent au bannissement du coupable, rompant ainsi, par son
expulsion, les liens qui le rattachaient au γένος.’<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>All these critics appear to suggest that the early age of
Greece presents us with a more or less homogeneous but
undeveloped and quasi-barbarous race<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which slowly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
gradually evolves into something like civilisation in the time
of Dracon and Solon. Thus conceived, the homicide-customs
of Homer are very similar to those of the Montenegrins of
modern times, who have long lived in a condition of social
chaos and who accept, in atonement for homicide, a payment
of money when there is hardly anyone left to pay it!</p>

<p>Leaf, who in <i>Homer and History</i><a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (1915) differentiates
very clearly between the Pelasgian and the Achaean elements
in the societies of Homeric Greece, points out that to the
Achaeans ‘homicide is a local and family affair, and brings
no disability other than exile from home.’ A wealthy and
generous king can give opportunities of advancement beyond
all the hopes of a narrow family circle. To an ambitious
Achaean (as witness Patroclus,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Phoenix<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and others<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>),
exile in such circumstances is not a real punishment. When
Leaf observes, in regard to the Achaeans, that ‘thus the
most sacred of all taboos, the shedding of kindred blood,
loses its final sanction,’ he seems to hint at the existence, in
the Homeric society, of a non-Achaean attitude to homicide.
He does not however explain the precise nature or origin of
this attitude.</p>

<p>Moreover, in <i>Homer and History</i>, Leaf does not suggest
any solution of an important problem to which he refers in
previous works—the problems presented by the reference to
wergeld in the Homeric passage which describes the Shield
of Achilles.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In a note of his translation of the <i>Iliad</i> (1883),
he said<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>: ‘The trial scene is one of the most difficult and
puzzling passages in Homer.... The whole passage is clearly
archaic, but the difficulty lies in the fact that no parallel, so far
as we know, is to be found in the procedure of any primitive
races which throws any light upon this passage.’ In his
<i>Companion to the Iliad</i> (1892) and in his latest edition of the
<i>Iliad</i> (1902), in a note on the passage in question,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he put
forward an hypothesis which seems to suggest that he conceives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the Homeric Greeks as quasi-barbarous peoples. Having indicated
the frequency of blood-for-blood retaliation in the <i>Iliad</i>,
he interprets the trial-scene as representing a stage in the
evolution of homicide customs from more primitive conditions.
‘It seems absolutely necessary to assume an intermediate
stage in which the community asserted the right to say in every
case whether the next of kin should, for reasons of public
policy, accept compensation, and the missing link is apparently
brought before us here.’</p>

<p>By assuming that the trial-scene represents, not a murder
trial (which few now maintain) nor yet a wergeld debt trial,
<i>i.e.</i> an inquiry as to whether wergeld has been paid or not,
but a piece of novel homicide legislation, Leaf thinks that
‘the scene gains enormously in importance.’ Postponing for a
time<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> our criticism of this view, published thirteen years before
the date of <i>Homer and History</i>, and deferring the solution
which we shall offer of the difficulty, we proceed to state our
own theory of the homicide customs of Homer. This theory is
based in the first place on a distinction between an Achaean
dominant caste and a subject Pelasgian people; secondly, on
the hypothesis which Leaf puts forward as to the different
character and mode of life of the Achaeans and the Pelasgians—the
former being conceived as a race of bellicose military
adventurers living in isolated groups; the latter, as an agricultural
subject-people, tillers of the soil, who preserved intact
their tribal organisations; thirdly, on the connexion existing
between the homicide customs of a people or caste and
their temperament and social organisation—a connexion
which is established by a general study of blood-vengeance
amongst various peoples; and, finally, on a correct interpretation
of the text of Homer.</p>

<p>Our theory is as follows: there existed in Greece at the
period of the Achaean domination (1300-1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) two
fundamentally distinct social strata, each having a distinct
characteristic attitude to homicide, and observing distinct
modes of blood-vengeance. The two modes coexisted side
by side without affecting or modifying each other, but their
coexistence produced a slight confusion of thought and an
absence of clear discrimination in language in the Homeric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
poet (or poets) who were in contact with the two social strata,
and who were familiar with the two modes of vengeance, but
who almost ignored the one and exalted the other, out of
courtesy to the masters whose praises they sang. These two
modes of vengeance, which we will call respectively Achaean
and Pelasgian, may be thus described: (1) Amongst the
Achaeans the normal penalty for homicide is death. Their
system is private vendetta, of a restricted character, such
as we have already described in our introductory chapter.
The vengeance is quite personal and individual, that is, the
murderer alone is liable to the blood feud, which is therefore
neither collective nor hereditary. Vengeance is a duty which
devolves upon the dead man’s sons or brothers, but we may
include the possibility of support from a kindred of limited
extent<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>: a kindred which may be an embryonic clan, but
whose attitude to homicide is quite different from that which
normally characterises a clan. Wergeld is not accepted,
even though it is known to exist outside the caste: exile is
not a recognised appeasement or atonement, but is merely
a flight from death, and the Achaean murderer frequently
takes refuge with a king or a wealthy man. We shall
describe this Achaean system more fully in a later chapter.
(2) The Pelasgian mode will be found to be that which
we have described in the Introduction as the ‘tribal wergeld’
mode, though it may have evolved from a more barbarous
mode before 1300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In this system there are three or
four recognised alternative penalties: (1) ‘wergeld,’ which is
the normal measure of vengeance or retribution, and which
is so frequently associated with tribalism; (2) exile, which
involves a formal and solemn expulsion from the ‘group,’ a
serious penalty for anyone born and bred in the atmosphere
of tribal life and religion; (3) death, which is rarely inflicted,
but is a possible alternative if neither ‘wergeld’ nor exile
is accepted by the murderer or his clan; (4) we may add,
with Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> though there is no definite Homeric evidence for
its existence, the option of slavery or servitude. This is not
the slavery which is found in later times in Home and in Greece,
when there was a regular slave trade, nor is it the temporary
‘slavery’ which is involved in being ‘kidnapped’ and held to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
ransom—a frequent occurrence in Homer; it is, however,
akin to this latter condition, inasmuch as it involves a state
of bondage, from which a murderer can be redeemed, not by
the payment of such a price as his ‘redeemer’ can be induced
to pay, but by the payment of such valuables as have been
determined by long tradition—his quota of the wergeld of
the clan.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Proofs from the Text of Homer</span></h4>

<p>In our introductory chapter we pointed out the connexion
which exists between the homicide customs of a people or
caste and their temperamental outlook and social organisation;
we have quoted Seebohm’s views as to the essentially tribal
character of the wergeld-exile-death system; and, therefore,
anyone who accepts Leaf’s hypothesis as to the nature of the
Achaean and Pelasgian social strata will be prepared to admit
that our hypothesis as to Pelasgian blood-vengeance is logically
<i>a priori</i> probable. In a later chapter we shall seek further
confirmation of our theory by explaining the difference in the
religious beliefs of the Achaeans and the Pelasgians, and by
indicating their different attitudes to the judicial aspect of
homicide. We now proceed to the crucial test of our opinions—the
evidence of the Homeric poems.</p>

<p>In Homer the word ποινή occurs very frequently. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
thinks the word is connected with the verb τίνειν (to pay).
He says: ‘De vrai, ποινή doit être rapproché de τίνω et des
mots apparentés, τίνυμι, τιμάω, τίσις, τιμή.’ Others<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
however hold that it is connected with the root <i>pu</i>, found in
Greek πῦρ, and Latin <i>purus</i>, <i>punire</i>, <i>poena</i>. The word ἄποινα
seems akin in origin to ποινή, but in Homer it is invariably
used of a ransom or gift of valuables.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We do not think
that Glotz<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has quite succeeded in his attempt to prove
the evolution of the word ποινή from an earlier meaning of
‘blood-vengeance’ to a later one of pecuniary satisfaction, at
least within the limits of the Homeric poems. His reasoning
is very similar to that known as ‘squaring one’s premises
to one’s conclusions’: he is not aware of any distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
between Achaeans and Pelasgians, and he finds the Homeric
use of ποινή rather difficult to explain. He must have
been aware of the fact—one which we consider of great
importance—that in Homer the word ποινή nearly always
means ‘punishment’ or ‘revenge’ rather than ‘compensation’
or ‘ransom’: he is certainly aware that, while ποινή
can mean a pecuniary satisfaction for a material wrong or
injury, and can mean the ‘ransom’ of a captive or of a warrior’s
dead body, nevertheless there are only two instances in all
Homer in which ποινή can be formally interpreted to mean
wergeld. Thus he says,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> ‘On songe aux deux passages de
l’Iliade où il est formellement parlé de composition pour
homicide. Ce sont le discours d’Ajax à Achille au chant ix
et la scène judiciaire figurée sur le bouclier d’Achille au
chant xviii.’ It is by a close examination of these two
passages that we hope to solve the difficulty connected with
the Homeric ποινή. But, first, let us say that the word
ποινή is precisely the kind of word which may easily possess
a general as well as a special significance. The ideas of ‘payment’
and ‘punishment’ may, in certain circumstances,
coalesce: and it is probably because Homer was subconsciously
aware of the fusion of ideas involved in the use of the word
ποινή, that he employs another word of kindred meaning,
ἄποινα, to denote a payment in which the idea of ‘punishment’
is absent or obscured.</p>

<p>In Homer, the word ποινή is used to denote a variety of
ideas ranging from ‘punishment in general,’ such as death
inflicted in vengeance, to ‘compensation for injury’: thus in
<i>Iliad</i> xvi. 398 Patroclus, having slain many foemen in battle,
is said to have thus exacted vengeance (or payment) for many
Greeks who had fallen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">κτεῖνε μεταΐσσων, πολέων δ’ ἀπετίνυτο ποινήν.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is no question of ‘payment of goods’ or ‘wergeld’;
it is merely the vengeance which a warrior inflicts upon his
enemies. In <i>Iliad</i> xxi. 28 Achilles chooses out twelve Trojan
youths whom he afterwards burns on a funeral pyre. His
motive may have been to placate the shade of Patroclus, by
sending him ‘souls’ to be his slaves in Hades, or, less probably,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to gratify the desire of the shade for vengeance. The youths
are spoken of as ποινὴ Πατροκλοῖο: clearly they are not
‘goods or valuables,’ and are neither ‘paid’ nor ‘received.’
The poet may have been conscious of an undercurrent of
meaning, if he had known of bondage or slavery as a
penalty for murder in the tribes. But the slaying of Patroclus
was not murder! The ποινή of Patroclus is not even ordinary
blood-vengeance, it is merely the retaliation of an indignant
warrior.</p>

<p>Again, in <i>Odyssey</i> xxiii. 312 Odysseus tells Penelope how
he exacted from the Cyclops punishment for the slaying
of his companions,—ὡς ἀπετίσατο ποινὴν ἰφθίμων ἑτάρων.
The Cyclops was regarded by Homer and the Achaeans as one
of a lawless band of men who, as the poet says, ‘have no
plants or plough, no gatherings for council nor laws—each
one giveth law to his children and wives, and they reck not
of one another’: he was thus the very antithesis of tribal
or of civic society. The payment exacted was not wergeld,
but the loss of an eye! In <i>Iliad</i> v. 266 ποινή denotes merely
compensation for injury—there being no question of murder
at all. Zeus, having carried off Ganymede, the son of Tros,
gave Tros a gift of horses as compensation—υἷος ποινήν
Γανυμήδεος. It was really a case of ‘kidnapping,’ but
Ganymede was not ‘held to ransom’—a price is paid for
his loss, which is very different from wergeld.</p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i> xiv. 483 Akamas having slain Promachus tells
how ‘Promachus sleeps, done to death by my sword, lest a
brother’s vengeance (ποινή) be too long unpaid.’ Here we
have a formula of blood-vengeance applied to the collective
vengeance of war. Akamas does not seek the life of Ajax,
the slayer of his brother, but is satisfied by slaying any individual
of the enemy as a ‘satisfaction’ for his brother.
But there is no question of wergeld: death is the penalty
desired and exacted. Though the phrase δηρὸν ἄτιτος could
be regarded as a reminiscence of the wergeld system, in
which a period of time was normally allowed for payment,
it is quite naturally applicable to blood-for-blood revenge,
as δηρὸν can simply mean ‘a long time,’ and the tendency
of such vengeance was to quick retribution.</p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i> xiii. 659 we are told of the slaying in battle of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Harpalion, son of Pylaimenes, king of the Paphlagonians.
‘And the Paphlagonians tended him busily, and set him in
a chariot and drove him to Ilios sorrowing, and with them
went his father, shedding tears, and there was no atonement
(ποινή) for his dead son.’ It is obvious that even if we
suppose the Paphlagonians (who were not Achaeans) to have
had clans and tribes and wergeld payments in their normal
home life, we cannot attribute to them any expectation of
wergeld for a man killed on the field of battle. Nor could
the absence of such a compensation, to a king who had much
more wealth than he could ever enjoy, be regarded as a cause
of tears. Hence the word ποινή here must mean blood-vengeance,
the satisfaction arising from blood-for-blood
retribution: and this satisfaction was frustrated because
the Paphlagonians did not happen to see the man who slew
Harpalion.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>There are only two passages in Homer in which ποινή
unmistakably refers to the genuine wergeld penalty. If
those passages were missing no one could speak of wergeld
as a penalty for homicide in the society described by Homer.
We shall now examine those passages with a view to showing
that they do not represent the normal system of the dominant
Achaean caste, but are merely what Leaf would call ‘reminiscences,’
traces of a system with which Homer and the
Achaeans were familiar, but which they did not adopt or
practise amongst themselves.</p>

<p>In the first passage (<i>Iliad</i> ix. 632-7) the scene is the tent
of Achilles before Troy. Owing to the secession of Achilles
from the Greek fighting-line the Trojans had been rapidly
gaining the upper hand and the Greeks were only saved from
destruction by the sudden approach of night.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> An embassy
is sent from Agamemnon to Achilles to induce him to waive
his wounded pride in the interest of the Achaeans, and promising
not only the restoration of his concubine Briseis but also a
grant of seven cities in the Peloponnese and many splendid
gifts. Achilles rejects every possible ‘satisfaction’<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
implies that the insult offered to him was so great that nothing
short of the destruction of Agamemnon and his army would
assuage his wrath. Odysseus and Phoenix having failed to
bend his haughty spirit, the third member of the embassy,
Ajax, son of Telamon, who was certainly an Achaean, reproached
him with his indifference to the fate of his Achaean
comrades, who loved him, and reminded him of the self-control
possessed by other men in directing their passion
for revenge, even when afflicted by a much graver injury—that
of murder. ‘Yet,’ he says, ‘doth a man accept payment
(ποινή) from the murderer of his brother or for the slaying
of his son: and the manslayer abideth in his home-land when
he hath paid a goodly price, and the man’s heat and proud
spirit is restrained when he hath accepted the payment—but
for thee the gods have put within thy breast an evil and implacable
spirit.’ When Ajax delivered this speech, he had
already despaired of the success of the embassy<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>: and he
mentioned the act of the receiver of wergeld, not as the
act of a normal Achaean hero—the Achaeans of the Homeric
age are of a very different type—but as an act which was
characteristic of a well-known kind of temperament, an act
which, he thought, might serve to emphasise the extreme
abnormality of Achilles’ desire for vengeance. If Achilles
had had a son or a brother who was murdered, and if he were
on the point of crushing a whole village in revenge, the argument
of Ajax would have been more relevant to the case, but
even then it could not be taken to imply that either Ajax
or Achilles was a member of a society in which wergeld
was a recognised penalty. It is significant also that Achilles,
in his reply, makes no reference whatsoever to this argument.
Viewing Homer as a whole, it seems more than probable that
this almost solitary instance of wergeld was introduced by
the poet, who<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was aware of the existence of the wergeld
system, but was not concerned with its details. We need
not call attention to the non-factual nature of recorded speeches
even in Greek prose writers, and <i>a fortiori</i> in the epic poets
who reconstructed speeches more or less as a historical novelist
would at the present day. It is in a similarly casual way that
Homer gives us his one solitary reference to a common tillage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
field<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>—a reference which Ridgeway makes a basis for very
wide generalisations as to Homeric land-tenure. No Achaean
uses the words: they are the poet’s own: hence they can
easily be applied to conditions of tenure with which the poet
was himself acquainted, but which were not necessarily adopted
by the Achaeans during their domination in Greece. In
regard to the wergeld passage, Glotz suggests that, while the
verses themselves would lead one to suppose that a certain
‘superior force’ constrained the kinsman of the victim to
forgo blood-vengeance by accepting a blood-price, still they
do not prove that there was any ‘social justice’ to intervene
and impose a settlement or to indicate the amount of the
wergeld.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This view we cannot accept. There is no
explicit<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> reference, of course, to any ‘social justice,’ but
the temperament which forgoes blood-vengeance and accepts
wergeld is the product of a social system which restricts
and controls the human passion for revenge. The Achaeans
were above and outside such a system: the Pelasgians, we
think, were born and bred in it,—perhaps for centuries.
Allegiance to his tribal or civic unit and its laws alone could
restrain primitive man—especially in Southern climes where
passion dies very hard—from following the promptings of
his natural blood-thirst. In course of time individual members
of a settled agricultural tribe would inevitably develop a
restrained temperament, through their fear of violating those
unwritten laws of which Antigone said<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that they ‘are not
of to-day or yesterday, but no man knows the time which
gave them birth.’ The Achaeans, who lived in every-day
contact with such types of men, must have observed even
though they did not imitate their self-restraint, and all the
more because it was a quality which the Achaean caste-atmosphere
could not produce.</p>

<p>The second of the two genuine wergeld passages in Homer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
is found in the description of the Shield of Achilles.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This
passage raises many problems and causes serious difficulties
to Homeric scholars. Ridgeway, who holds that the Achaean
shield was of a round shape, and who assumes that the Shield
of Achilles was therefore round, still finds nothing in Homer’s
description to suggest that the Achaeans manufactured this
particular shield. ‘It is probable,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> ‘that whilst
the shape of the shield and the style or ornament are derived
from central Europe, its technique discloses the native
Mycenaean craftsman employing for his Achaean lords the
method seen in Mycenaean daggers.’ Monro<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> also points
out that ‘in choice of subjects and in the manner of treatment
there is a remarkable agreement between the Mycenaean remains
and the Shield of Achilles.’ All the pictures, he observes,
are taken from incidents of every-day life, and the absence of
any references to commerce or seafaring life suggests the
antiquity of the picture.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Leaf, in his translation of the <i>Iliad</i>
(1883),<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> makes the following comment: ‘The whole passage
is clearly archaic, but the difficulty lies in the fact that no
parallel, so far as we know, is to be found in the procedure of
any primitive races which throws any light upon this passage.
Homer so constantly represents the kings as the keepers of
the “traditions,” and therefore sole judges, that he must have
been consciously moving in some different world when he
depicted the Shield: a world, too, in which there is no mythology
and no sacrifice and nothing distinctly Hellenic.’ In
his <i>Companion to the Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (1892) and in his latest edition
of the <i>Iliad</i> (1902) he has proposed a solution<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of the problems
raised by this passage. He suggests that the passage does
not refer to a murder-trial, nor yet to an inquiry into the
question of payment of wergeld (as he held in his translation<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
of the <i>Iliad</i>), but that it is an account of the establishment
of a new murder-code, which abolishes private vendetta and
substitutes a compulsory ‘wergeld’ system. We will now
quote the portion of this famous passage which relates to
homicide—and we will offer a solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>On the Shield are depicted, amongst other things, two cities,
one of which is in a state of siege, the other in a condition of
peace. It is with the latter city that we are here concerned.
In this city two ‘events’ are described: the first is a wedding,
concerning which we need only say that it is an event of common
occurrence, which is not in the least degree novel or abnormal;
the second event<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> is a dispute about the ransom of a slain
man, which takes place in the ἀγορά of the city, in the
presence of the Elders, of the sacred heralds, and of a cheering
crowd of people. Leaf’s original translation (1883) (some
of which he has since abandoned, not, as we think, wisely)
is as follows: ‘But the folk were gathered in the assembly-place;
for there a strife was arisen, two men striving about
the blood-price of a slain man: the one avowed that he had
paid all ... but the other denied that he had received aught,
manifesting it to the people: and each was fain to obtain
consummation on the word of his witness<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>: and the folk
were cheering both, as they took part on either side. And
heralds kept order among the folk, while the Elders on polished
stones were sitting in the sacred circle and holding in their
hands staves from loud-voiced heralds. Then before the
people they rose up and gave judgment each in turn. And
in the midst lay two talents of gold to be given unto him who
should plead among them most righteously.’</p>

<p>This is the traditional view, which regards the scene as
an investigation by the Elders of the city as to whether a
recognised wergeld has or has not been paid. It is followed
by Glotz, who proposes however some curious explanations
of details, which we shall presently discuss. It is the view
which we shall adopt when we have explained more precisely
the exact nature of the ‘court.’</p>

<p>There is however a second view, adopted by Leaf in 1887,
1892 and 1902, first propounded by Müncher (1829), and
supported by other scholars,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which regards the scene as
describing the first interference on the part of some higher
authority with the chaotic blood-feuds of savages.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the view of Lipsius that the trial was a
genuine murder-trial, and that the two talents of gold referred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to by the poet represented a genuine wergeld. This view
is now generally rejected and we shall see presently the objections
which militate against it: but our first duty is to formulate
the arguments which will induce us to accept the first and to
reject the second hypothesis.</p>

<p>First of all, we have already protested against the opinion
which represents the early Greeks as cannibals living in a
state of barbarism. In our view, the only period of Greek
history to which such a conception may, with any justice,
be applied is the period of the Dark Ages which succeeded
the Trojan war, when continual migrations and the breakdown
of tribal solidarity gave a temporary reality to the picture
which is drawn for us by Hesiod. The Pelasgian, Minoan,
and Achaean periods, however, present to our minds societies
enjoying a civilisation which was regular and orderly, and a
culture which was real and distinctive, even though it was
also primitive. Again, the arguments which Leaf bases on
the linguistic interpretation of one or two verbs in this
passage are not only inconclusive for his hypothesis, as Glotz
rightly holds,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but suggest, we think, the opposite deduction.
In 1883 Leaf translated the words ὀ μὲν εὔχετο
πάντ’ ἀποδοῦναι ... ὁ δ’ ἀναίνετο μηδὲν ἑλέσθαι as ‘the one
avowed that he had paid all ... the other denied that he
had received aught’: but in his latest edition of the <i>Iliad</i>
(1902) he translates them (to suit his changed hypothesis)
thus: ‘the one offered to pay all ... the other refused to
accept aught.’ He admits, of course, that the verbs can have
the meaning which he gave to them in 1883. But he omits
to note the solitary word πάντα which we consider a decisive
factor. If a man is said to ‘pay all’ surely that ‘all’ must
have been a sum fixed by a traditional arrangement. We
can find no parallel, in wergeld-paying communities, for a
judicial decision on the part of the tribe which compels a
relative of the victim to accept the wergeld which the
tribe of which he is a member has traditionally recognised
as the complete payment of the debt. It is only if payment
is in default or dispute that the tribe would assert itself
to prevent a feud of blood. When Homer adds, after the
clause ὁ δ’ ἀναίνετο μηδὲν ἑλέσθαι, the words δήμῳ πιφαύσκων,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
surely this means ‘declaring it to the people’ rather than
‘manifesting it to the people,’ for it is absurd to suppose that
the actual wergeld was included in the scene, since such
a payment, as we have shown, usually consisted of cattle and
sheep.</p>

<p>Again, we may mention what we consider a very serious
weakness in Leaf’s later position. He has to assume that the
scene in question is not a single scene, but two scenes.
He thus describes the affair in his <i>Companion to the Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
(1892). ‘A man has been slain: the homicide has offered a
money payment in commutation of the death, but the next
of kin refuses to accept it. Both parties come into the
public place attended by their friends and dispute. This
scene ends here. The next scene shows us the dispute referred
to the Elders, the King’s Council, who are to decide
what course is to be taken. The importance of this double
scene lies in the fact that it shows us criminal law in its very
birth. No criminal law can be said to exist when it is a matter
for private arrangement between the homicide and the next
of kin to settle the offence, if they like, by a money payment,
instead of by the normal blood revenge, which means the exile
of the homicide if he is not killed. But criminal law begins
when the people claim to have a voice in the question and to
say that the money shall be accepted.’ We will merely say,
by way of comment, that this two-scene theory not only is
artistically improbable but finds no support whatever in the
text of Homer.</p>

<p>A period of thirteen years separated the date of the <i>Companion</i>
from that of the publication of <i>Homer and History</i>.
Though in this latter work he does not mention the Shield of
Achilles, still we feel that if Leaf had applied his later theory of
the distinction between Achaeans and Pelasgians to the solution
of his earlier problem, he could have thrown considerable light
on the question. In 1883 it was the absence of a king in the
trial that troubled him. But is it not now clear that the
‘Kings’ of Greece from 1300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> were Achaeans,
bellicose war-lords, who held in their hands the ‘sceptres’ and
dealt out dooms to the people, but who took little interest
in local disputes, who did not understand, perhaps, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
probably did not adopt, many of the Pelasgian ‘dooms’?<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Hence, if we suppose that the Elders in this scene are not
Achaeans but Pelasgian chiefs of clans and tribes, we can
quite easily understand the absence of the Achaean king or
over-lord.</p>

<p>Leaf gives us a very clear picture in <i>Homer and History</i><a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
which we may utilise to remove the difficulties which he felt
in 1883. ‘All this time,’ he says, ‘the main population of
Greece was going on with beliefs and customs undisturbed,
unaffected by the change of masters<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> at the Castle. The
group society of the Pelasgians—φυλή, γένος, φρατρία—continued
intact, abiding its time. The epic of the Achaeans
takes no notice of it, why should it? The Achaeans knew
little and cared less about the customs of their subjects, unless
at times called in to settle disputes based on silly family usage,
unworthy of a lord’s notice.’ Though Leaf does not say so
explicitly, we think that in his conception of the Homeric
wergeld he is now much nearer to the position he held in 1883
than to the positions he adopted in the intervening period.</p>

<p>If we combine then the arguments based on the text of
this Homeric passage with the results of Leaf’s latest researches
and also with the general principles outlined in our Introductory
Chapter, we may conclude that this trial-scene
presents us with a genuine wergeld dispute, not within the
Achaean caste, but amongst the Pelasgian tribal folk. We
have seen that scholars are unanimous in holding that the
Shield is of an essentially Mycenaean and therefore Pelasgian
pattern. We have quoted Seebohm at length for the connexion
between the wergeld-system of homicide-compensation
and tribal organisation and control.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> We have quoted
Leaf’s recent views as to the probable existence of clans and
tribes among the Pelasgian subject-people. The conclusion
we have drawn is therefore a practically self-evident deduction
from assumed premises.</p>

<p>Before we apply this general conclusion to the solution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of minor difficulties presented by this Homeric passage, it
may be desirable to discuss briefly the view of Lipsius which
has been already mentioned. He maintains that the trial
in question was a murder-trial—a decision of homicidal guilt
or innocence: he therefore holds that the two talents of gold
were the actual wergeld. He says<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>: ‘Upon him (of the
claimants) who, according to their (<i>i.e.</i> the judges’) opinion—at
any rate in the verdict of the majority—has given his
opinion best, are bestowed two talents of gold which have
been laid down in front of them. They (<i>i.e.</i> the talents)
constitute, therefore, the objects of the dispute, the amount
of the blood-atonement which the accused deposits and is
to get back in case of victory,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> but otherwise must transfer
to the plaintiff.’ This opinion has been attacked on many
grounds, but chiefly on the ground that the sum of two
(Homeric) talents of gold is too small to constitute a wergeld-payment.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
But it does not follow that the Achaean standard
of values was necessarily that of their Pelasgian subjects.
Even though it is true that in Homer a goodly price is paid
for a freeman sold as a slave<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; for a woman<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>; and for
the ransom of the kidnapped son of a king<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; although a
‘ransom unspeakable’ (ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα) is offered for a
warrior’s life on the field of battle<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; and Lycaon, son of
Priam, is kidnapped and sold as a slave for 100 oxen and
liberated by a ransom of 300 oxen<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>:—although ten talents
of gold is an insignificant portion of the ‘placation’ offered
to Achilles,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and two talents of gold is the reward paid by
Aegisthus to his scout,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> there is nothing in all this to prove
that, amongst the poor tribal tillers of the soil, the sum of
two talents of gold (which, though it was not real money, was
still a valuable commodity) may not have sufficed as wergeld
for a tribal race ruled over by strangers. The really insuperable
objections which we find to the view of Lipsius are the
following: In the first place tribal wergeld, even where it
is comparatively small, as it was in Ireland under the Brehon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Laws, is generally a collection of numerous valuables, whether
cows or sheep or slaves. Even when money is substituted,
the coins are small in value but numerous<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> (<i>e.g.</i> 200 solidi,
400 argentei). The reason for this lies in the diffused nature of
the responsibility for payment, quite a number of families
and individuals of the wider kindred being liable to contribution.
Secondly, there is no parallel, in analogous instances
of wergeld, for the assumption that the total amount was
collected and deposited in court at any time, much less before
the validity of the murder-charge had been established. In
this case, the accused asserts (according to Lipsius’ translation)
that he had paid the whole sum: but surely ἀποδοῦναι cannot
be taken to mean ‘that the accused had deposited in court
the normal wergeld.’ How could the accused assert that
he had paid it, how could the plaintiff deny that he had
received it—if the actual wergeld were deposited in court
before their very eyes? Thirdly, to say that the two talents
would be given to the most convincing pleader is a very
strange way of describing a judgment of guilty or not guilty
on a charge of homicide. Thus the text of Homer refutes
the theory of Lipsius. Maine<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> indicates the real function
of the two talents in this court by showing that they served
the same purpose as the <i>sacramentum</i> or court-fee of Roman
law.</p>

<p>Assuming then that the court here described by Homer
was a group of Pelasgian tribal chiefs or elders who could
regularly be appealed to in such disputes, and who would also
perform the functions of a murder-court if any person accused
of homicide appealed to them to establish his innocence, we
shall conclude our discussion by clearing up some minor points
of difficulty.</p>

<p>We cannot concur with Glotz<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in the opinion that the
result of the verdict is a matter of life or death for the
murderer. He says ‘Il peut y avoir un jugement de condamnation
entraînant l’esclavage ou la mort.’<a id="FNanchor_158b" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But quick
justice is not a characteristic of the wergeld-exile-slavery-death
system. We have seen how<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> among the Welsh tribes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
wergeld was paid in fortnightly instalments: and we may
suppose that failure to pay any one instalment would have
been a common subject for litigation. In the laws of
King Edmund of England (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 940-946) a period of twelve
months<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> was allowed for payment of wergeld—‘to prevent
manifold fightings.’ In the laws of Henry I. the period was
fixed by ‘Sapientes.’</p>

<p>Again, in this Homeric passage as it is usually interpreted,
both pleaders cannot have been right. Payment of wergeld
was very different from a modern transfer of cash. It involved
a complete readjustment of the whole property of two clans,
so that hundreds of people were aware of the transaction.
If however we suppose that a portion of the wergeld was
unpaid, it will be possible to maintain that both parties were
<i>bona fide</i> in their assertions. We will assume that Homer,
whether he is indulging his imagination or describing something
which he had actually seen on a shield, is giving us
an account of a typical wergeld dispute such as must
commonly have taken place in Pelasgian life: we must
especially remember that the accused (whom we assume to be
the murderer) and the plaintiff are isolated members of large
groups concerned in the payment, though the accused would
normally have to pay the greatest individual share, and the
plaintiff, if he was the nearest relative of the slain, would
receive a large share of the wergeld. Let us suppose, then,
that some of the wergeld had been paid, and that the part
which had not been paid was due, not from the murderer
himself or his immediate relatives,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> but from some distant
family of cousins who, unknown to the defendant, had
defaulted or were unable to pay. We can, on this assumption,
credit the defendant (that is, the murderer) with <i>bona fides</i>.
Or again, assuming still that the defendant is the murderer,
if we suppose that the disputed ‘instalment’ had been received,
unknown to the plaintiff, by a distant family of his
wider kindred for whom he is acting as the leading ‘avenger’
in negotiation—in a word, if we suppose that both litigants
are acting as representatives of large groups, we can understand
the contradiction in their statements which would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
less intelligible if they were speaking for themselves personally.
And have we not here a clue as to the constitution of the
crowd which attended at the trial? Homer distinctly says
that the crowd ‘cheered on both parties’<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>: and he adds:
‘taking part on either side’<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>: so interested were they in
the issue, that the heralds had to maintain order.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This
implies that there was a certain danger of rioting amongst
the crowd—of something like the ‘manifold fightings’<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of
the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>We cannot agree with the general view that this scene
must be expected to contain a picture of intense public
interest.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The parallel scene, in the city at peace, is a
wedding! The Shield-picture contains also a reaping scene
and a ploughing scene. Surely the artist was not so much
at pains to reveal subjects of public interest as to depict
topics of common occurrence. To us it seems obvious that
one of the most frequent scenes of tribal life was a wergeld
dispute: and as this dispute concerned the property of a
large number of people, all such persons would be naturally
interested in the verdict. In all ancient codes prominence
is given to laws relating to theft, to inheritance, to marriage
settlements and the like, rather than to what we should now
consider graver matters. The reason is, that all ancient
thought and religion centred around questions of property.
Hence we think it more than probable that the ‘folk’ of the
Homeric trial scene are not the general public but are
rather the wider kinsmen of the plaintiff and the defendant.
It would be not only natural but also right that they should
have supported each one his own side, just as they would do
in the event of a clan feud. But the success with which the
heralds checked the passions of the people shows how very
different the ancient Pelasgians were from the barbarous
races who only accept wergeld under duress, and who hail
with triumph the slightest pretext for another feud. Glotz,
who thinks of the Pelasgians as he would of any barbarous
primitive people, thinks therefore that in this scene the crowd
came together armed to the teeth! ‘Les hostilités, un instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
suspendues, menacent d’éclater à nouveau. Les deux ennemis
qui déjà se résignaient mal à une transaction, échangent des
injures, en attendant qu’ils se cherchent les armes à la main.’<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>What now, we may ask, is the meaning of ἴστωρ in this
passage? Homer says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἄμφω δ’ ἱέσθην ἐπὶ ἴστορι πεῖραρ ἑλέσθαι.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Leaf, in 1883, translated thus: ‘and each one was fain to
obtain consummation on the word of his witness.’ Later
(1892 and 1902), when he conceived that there were really
two scenes described in the picture, he regarded the ἴστωρ
as an arbitrator: ‘each one relied on an arbitrator to
win the suit.’ We can only say that while the etymology
and use of the word ἴστωρ permit of both interpretations,
the relation of the verse to its context seems to us immeasurably
in favour of the interpretation ‘witness.’ We may
presume that the ‘witnesses’ were included in the ‘people’
and were brought forward to prove the actual transference
of property which had or had not taken place. They are,
therefore, similar to the ‘compurgators’ who figure so
prominently in medieval litigation.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Since Homer, then, the poet of the Achaeans, has given us
only two incidental references to wergeld, we are not surprised
that he has told us nothing about the details of the
system. We may indeed infer that the amount payable
was very large,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but Glotz reveals how little he is himself
acquainted with the system when he asserts<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that the
offender only escaped death at the cost of ruin. ‘La ποινή,’
he says, ‘c’est une large, parfois peut-être une totale
dépossession de l’offenseur au profit de la partie lésée. A la
mort juste on n’échappe que par la ruine.’ It is probable
that the payment took the form of ‘women, cattle, or horses.’<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
But in the absence of more definite evidence<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> we must fall
back on what we can learn from analogous instances. It
is for that reason that we have discussed at so much length
the wergeld system in our introductory chapter. We have
no doubt that the wergeld revealed by Homer was a genuine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
wergeld, and not a mere clumsy device for terminating the
feuds of savages exhausted by slaughter.</p>

<p>We must now search further, in the text of Homer, for
anything he may have to tell us of other alternative penalties
existing amongst the Pelasgian people. In this matter we
cannot trust to the analysis of Glotz, for he knows of no distinction
between Achaeans and Pelasgians, and hence his
account is misleading.</p>

<p>We may say at once that we cannot find any genuine
Pelasgian reference to the death penalty as an alternative, in
cases of homicide <i>outside the clan</i>, though from other analogies
and, indirectly, from Homer<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> we may infer that the option
was valid.</p>

<p>It is also doubtful if we can detect any genuine instances
of slavery as a penalty for homicide. Glotz calls attention<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
to a very curious custom which is found among some primitive
peoples, the custom of compelling a murderer to have himself
‘adopted’ by the ‘family’ of the victim. The murderer
takes the place of the dead man! Among the Ossetes ‘a
mother does not hesitate to recognise as her son the man who
has deprived her of her son’—but this adoption does not give
him a right to succeed to property. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> thinks it more
than probable that the same custom prevailed in the Homeric
epoch, for he regards wergeld as a kind of debt, and
slavery was a universal solvent of debt down to the time
of Solon, by whom it was still permitted in the case of a
daughter who was guilty of misconduct (<i>prise en faute</i>).<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The offer of a daughter in marriage by Agamemnon to Achilles,
in an age when men bought women as venal chattels, Glotz
regards as a species of wergeld (ποινή).<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He quotes<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
Apollodorus<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> for the eight years ‘captivity’ of Cadmus
with Ares whose son (the dragon) he had murdered—after
which Ares gave him his daughter in marriage.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> For having
massacred the Cyclopes,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Apollo became a shepherd in the
service of Admetus.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Heracles, having slain Iphitus, serves
Omphale for three years.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The only Homeric reference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
which Glotz mentions is a passage<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which describes the
year’s service of Apollo and Poseidon with Laomedon for a
sum of money, at the command of Zeus: they built the
walls of Troy, but Laomedon refused to pay their wages.
As there is here no question of murder, we may say that there
is nothing relevant about this Homeric passage.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Nor can
we attach any weight to legends presented by Apollodorus,
for, as we shall see, the abolition of wergeld in the seventh
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> made exile the inevitable penalty for murder
and left the murderer no property to take away with him,
and therefore he had little option but to accept menial service
with a stranger.</p>

<p>If we reflect on the nature of the wergeld system, we shall
see how difficult it would be to apply a penal form of slavery
in default of payment within a tribe or in any definite locality.
Wergeld was essentially a ‘diffused’ penalty, involving a
large number of debtors, any one of whom could, equally with
the murderer, be sold as a slave at the command of tribal
authorities. To enslave a distant relative<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of the murderer
for debt would constitute a severe form of collective punishment:
and it is much more probable that, in default of payment
on the part of any individual family, the deficiency would
have been contributed by the rest of the clan.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It is improbable
that an entire family or gwely would have been so
poor and needy that they could not by a series of instalments
have discharged the wergeld debt. In a law of Henry I.
it is decreed<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> that ‘Amends being set going (<i>i.e.</i> first
deposits being paid) the rest of the wergeld shall be paid
during a term to be fixed by the <i>Sapientes</i>.’ And we must not
ignore the role of the <i>phratores</i>, or of the <i>congildones</i>, who were
selected from neighbouring clans, and who might have to contribute
in certain emergencies. Thus, in another law of Henry
I. we read<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>: ‘If the slayer has no maternal (or paternal)
relations the <i>congildones</i> shall pay half, and for half he shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
flee or pay.’ In ancient tribal Ireland an instance of bondage
is related in the <i>Senchus Mor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> but failure to pay occurs only
in the case of an illegitimate son, who would normally have no
real share in family property. There is here, indeed, a sort
of ‘collectivity.’ Six men of the tribe of Conn of the Hundred
Battles, including four brothers and an illegitimate nephew,
had slain a brother who was under the protection of another
tribal chieftain. A compensation was demanded, which is not
so much wergeld as a fine payable to the chief. Five of
the six men were able to pay, but the illegitimate murderer
could not pay: so his mother was handed over to the tribe
as a bondwoman in pledge. However, the fact that the slain
man had been adopted by an outside tribe, and that the money
was paid to the chief, forbid the conclusion that money was
paid for murder within the kindred in tribal Ireland or that
kin-slaying was normally atoned for by bondage in the family
of the victim.</p>

<p>It may be urged that slavery was accepted as an expiation
of <i>manslaughter</i> within the kindred on the ground that
wergeld was impossible, that death was too dreadful, and
that perpetual exile or outlawry was too severe a punishment.
It is obvious, from the very nature of the case, that wergeld
cannot apply to bloodshed within the clan or the wider kindred.
Seebohm has found no instance of such a penalty amongst the
tribes whose customs he has investigated. He points out that
‘if it (<i>i.e.</i> <i>the murder</i>) was of someone within the kindred, there
was no slaying of the murderer. Under Cymric custom there
was no <i>galanas</i> (<i>i.e.</i> wergeld), nothing but execration and
ignominious exile.’<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>... ‘There is no feud within the kindred
when one kinsman slays another. Accidental homicide does
not seem to be followed even by exile. But murder breaks
the tribal tie, and is followed by outlawry.’<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> ‘Tribal
custom everywhere left the worst crime of all—murder of
a parent or kinsman—without redress, ... unavenged.’<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Glotz, also, holds that there was no drastic punishment for
bloodshed within the clan: ‘Rien qu’un parent fait contre un
parent n’est susceptible de châtiment.’<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But the graver
crimes against one’s kindred are penalised, he says, by exile:—‘La<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
peine la plus grave qui soit ordinairement infligée ...
c’est l’expulsion de la famille.’<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> We believe that in all clans
which worshipped ancestors kin-slaying was usually punished
by exile, perpetual or temporary. In a later chapter, when we
come to discuss the survival of primitive clan-customs in historical
Attica, the grounds for this belief will become apparent.
At present we will merely say, with Fustel de Coulanges,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
that kinsmen would not encourage the presence of a kin-slayer
as a slave in daily intercourse with his clan, nor would they
easily permit him to take part, at least for a time, in the worship
of the family hearth—of the clan ‘fire’ which he by his act
had to some extent extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> We prefer to see him, as
Glotz<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> describes it, stripped naked, and escorted to the clan
boundaries, beaten and insulted, declared an outlaw for years
or for ever for treason to his blood. Later, we shall see<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that
when Athenian State-magistrates are charged with the execution
of the sentence of death, the kin-slayer may no longer
escape, and his clan will refuse to have his corpse ‘gathered to
his fathers.’ It was thus that the King of the Wisigoths commanded
the judge to punish with death the kin-slayer who in
the system of ‘private vengeance’ saved his life by becoming
an outlaw from his clan.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>We find a reference to the exile penalty <i>for kin-slaying</i> in
Homer.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> We are told that Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by
Astyocheia, came to Troy from Rhodes, whither he had fled,
because when grown to manhood he had slain his father’s
maternal uncle, an old man, Likymnius, of the stock of Ares.
‘Then with speed he built ships and gathered much folk
together and went fleeing across the deep, because the other
sons and grandsons of the mighty Hercules threatened him.’
So he came to Rhodes, a wanderer, and his folk settled by
kinship in three tribes and were loved by Zeus.’ Leaf
would probably regard this passage as non-Homeric, since it
happens to occur in the ‘Catalogue’: but this will not vitiate
our argument, as the predominant atmosphere of post-Homeric
Greece was, in Leaf’s view, that of the ‘group-system’ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
there was no break in the custom of tribal wergeld. We may
assume<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that the family of Hercules was Pelasgian. Homer
does not mention the place where the slaying took place,
but it was, possibly, Mycenae, of which Electryon, father of
Likymnius, was at one time king. Likymnius was a half-brother
of Alcmene, the mother of Hercules, whose birth,
according to Homer,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> took place at Thebes. Likymnius
was, therefore, a maternal uncle of Hercules and grand-uncle
of Tlepolemus. In a normal clan the avengers of Likymnius
must have included the brothers of Tlepolemus, since the
homicide affected the whole kindred-group. The case is
remarkably similar to that described in <i>Beowulf</i>, and referred
to by F. Seebohm,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> but Beowulf took no part in the
quarrel between his maternal and paternal kindreds and the
quarrel was in violation of tribal usage. This is precisely the
kind of event which would have tested to the utmost the
solidarity of the kindred; for there was a clan law that all the
members who were akin either paternally or maternally had
to act together in the avenging of a kinsman. The murder of
Likymnius—who was not a kinsman of Amphitryon, grandfather
of Tlepolemus, but who was akin to Hercules, to
Tlepolemus and the brothers of Tlepolemus—was a crucial test,
as it involved a conflict between loyalty to clan law and loyalty
to one’s nearer relatives. When Homer speaks of the avengers of
Likymnius as the ‘sons and grandsons of the mighty Hercules,’
it does not follow that the family of Hercules were the sole
avengers, but that, as the nearest relatives of Tlepolemus, their
action was the most important, seeing that they were the
kinsmen whose obedience to clan law was most difficult and,
therefore, most appreciated.</p>

<p>Glotz<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> does not seem to us to have rightly interpreted
this passage. He refuses to believe that the duty of vengeance
was so strict as to compel a man to exercise it against a relative
of the paternal line, in the interest of a victim of the maternal
line. Moreover, he argues that the sons of Hercules are not
the avengers of Likymnius, for, if they were, they would not
have allowed him to depart. Here, we believe, Glotz is confusing
the exile penalty of Pelasgian tribes with the Achaean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
exile, which was a flight from death. They let him go,
says Glotz, because they wish to avoid a feud within the clan—‘Ils
veulent seulement que le meurtrier s’en aille, parce qu’ils
entendent ne pas se brouiller avec des alliés.’<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> We think,
on the contrary, that the case of Tlepolemus furnishes a
splendid instance of the solidarity of the clan. There was
no question of wergeld—nor, we think, of slavery. It was
a question of exile or death. The brothers of Tlepolemus
appear to lead the avengers. From this we need not infer
that Likymnius, an old man, had no sons or grandsons or
brothers living at the time. We have said that a clan conflict
was averted by the decision of the sons of Hercules to join in
avenging. Rather than tolerate in the clan society, in the
worship of common ancestors, the slayer of a kinsman, the
brothers of Tlepolemus would, if necessary, have killed him.
It is with <i>death</i> that they threatened him, if he remained.
But his exile was not a flight from death: he was granted a
certain time in which to build himself ships. Such delay is
characteristic of Pelasgian but not of Achaean vengeance.
There would be some difficulty in interpreting the reference
to the people whom he carried with him into exile, were it
stated, as fortunately it is not, that they were his kinsmen.
His companions were hangers-on, lackland men who were
content to join a powerful ‘exile’ emigrant. He founded in
Rhodes a city, in typical Pelasgian fashion,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> dividing the
folk by kinship into three tribes. It is perhaps because he
was a son of Hercules that his exile appears to be no excessive
penalty but a mere inconvenience. It is perhaps for
the same reason that he was loved by Zeus, the father of
Hercules.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>For the Pelasgian penalty of exile as an alternative
to wergeld for homicide <i>outside the kindred</i>, the most
relevant, though indirect, Homeric reference is a passage in
the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> which we have already discussed, in which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
hear of a man-slayer who abides among his people when he
has paid a goodly wergeld. We have already argued that
this passage refers to the tribal customs of the Pelasgians,
and that the Achaean Ajax, who uses the words, is
borrowing, for rhetorical purposes, a sentiment which did
not characterise the Achaean attitude to homicide.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> We
may now point out furthermore that the vagueness of the
description of the wergeld payment, both in this passage
and in that which relates to the Shield of Achilles, suggests,
if it does not prove, that the description proceeds from Achaeans
who were not familiar with the details of the system, but had
merely become acquainted with its outstanding principles.
When Homer says ‘a man has been known to accept a blood-price
for the death of a brother or a son,’ the statement is only
a vague description, as anyone who is familiar with real
wergeld will admit. We have seen that a large number of
people participated both in the payment and in the satisfaction.
Whether Homer can be taken to mean that exile would have
absolved the murderer’s kindred from all payment, as it did in
the laws of King Edmund of England,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> or whether it merely
acquitted the murderer of his share of the debt,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> are questions
which, owing to the vagueness of our Homeric references,
cannot here be decided.</p>

<p>These are the only Homeric references to the exile penalty
for homicide which can be definitely associated with Pelasgian
customs. There is a passage in the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> in which the
penalty is referred to, but we think it wiser to interpret the
passage as an Achaean reference, and to regard the exile as
a flight from death. Odysseus, having slain the suitors—an
action characterised by arbitrary Achaean hypervengeance—urges
his son Telemachus to consult with him and take joint
measures to prevent retaliation from the relatives of the slain.
He says to Telemachus: ‘A man who has slain a single individual
amongst the folk (ἐνὶ δήμῳ) goes into exile and leaves
his connexions and his native land, even when the slain man
has not many “helpers” left behind: but we have slain the
mainstay of the city, those who were noblest of the youths in
Ithaca, so I bid thee take thought upon the matter.’ The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
outlook of the Achaean over-lord is clearly indicated in this
passage, in the importance which Odysseus seems to attach
to the numbers or military strength of the avenging relatives.
For the Achaeans, murder went unavenged if there were no
avengers or if the avengers were not sufficiently powerful to
retaliate. Blood was rarely shed in vengeance, because the
murderer usually fled and took precautions against pursuit.
The idea of fleeing when the fear of ‘reprisals’ was negligible
was not very intelligible to an Achaean, and it is mentioned
here as an instance of unusual caution, in order to emphasise
the danger for Telemachus and Odysseus who remain unprepared
at home surrounded by a host of powerful and hostile
Ithacans. Later on, Odysseus suggests that music and
dancing should resound in the house to prevent the rumour
of the slaughter being disseminated until he has time to prepare
his plans.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> When, eventually, the truth became known,
the relatives of the suitors took counsel together,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> in the
manner of an Achaean council of war, but not as a Pelasgian
clan or tribe assembled to judge of guilt or innocence. Some
said that Odysseus was justified in his act; others prepare
for war. The fight ensues, and many are slain.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Athene<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
intervenes to reconcile the feud; she acts not as the patron
of clan law but as the symbol of Achaean military discipline.
Odysseus does not depart into exile: the covenant which the
outraged relatives submissively enter into came from the
throne of Zeus, and pledged them to serve the king for all his
days.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Neither can we put forward as evidence for the Pelasgian
exile penalty for homicide the passage in the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> in which
Priam’s inexplicable appearance before Achilles and his
friends evokes in them an emotion which Homer compares
to the amazement (θάμβος) felt when a man ‘slays one in
his country and goes into exile to the house of a rich man<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
and wonder possesses them that look at him.’ The amazement
here described would be equally natural whether the
stranger was an exiled Pelasgian or, as Leaf suggests,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> an
Achaean fleeing for his life. Moreover, suspicion has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
thrown upon the whole passage by the reference, in two
scholia, to ‘purification,’ which has led Müller<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> to infer
that the scholiasts read, in their texts, ἁγνιτέω instead of
ἀφνειοῦ. We hope to show later<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> the error of Müller’s
view that purification for homicide was a characteristic of
the Homeric age, and hence we maintain that either the whole
passage is a later interpolation or that the reading ἁγνιτέω
found its way into some Homeric texts from a marginal gloss
of post-Homeric origin, suggested by a false interpretation
of the word ἄτη in a preceding verse.</p>

<p>Hence, while the poems of Homer indicate beyond reasonable
doubt the existence of a genuine Pelasgian exile penalty,
it is significant that the poet of the Achaeans tends to ignore
the exile<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> alternative as he tends also to ignore the wergeld
alternative, in the system of penalties for homicide adopted
by a tribal people outside the Achaean caste.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Voluntary and Involuntary Homicide</span></h4>

<p>It is generally<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> asserted that primitive societies recognise
no distinction either between wilful murder and manslaughter
(which presumes a certain degree of guilt), or even between
wilful murder and accidental slaying. The reason assigned is
that bloodshed, even in comparatively advanced civilisations,
is a ‘civil’ rather than a ‘criminal’ offence—a matter for
damages and compensation rather than for exemplary punishment.
Thus Glotz<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> says: ‘L’intention n’est rien: le fait
est tout. Pas de circonstances atténuantes. Nulle différence
entre l’assassinat lâchement prémédité et l’homicide involontaire.’
To the possible objection that the distinction is found
in Greek legends, as given by Aeschylus, Apollodorus, Pausanias
and others, he replies that these legends are of late origin—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
view which is not quite consistent with his usual attitude.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
He thinks that those legends were invented by the Athenians
to restore the history of the Areopagus, the Palladium, and the
Delphinium courts.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> He attributes the moral distinction,
which these courts are assumed to imply, between voluntary
and involuntary homicide to a period ‘not much anterior to
Dracon,’ but he admits that the idea was being developed
before that time in ‘family law’—that is, in clan justice.
He seems to us rather inconsistent in holding that ‘dans les
lois sur l’homicide (de Dracon) apparaît pour la première
fois la distinction du meurtre prémédité et du meurtre involontaire,’
and in maintaining at the same time that it was a
‘principe lentement élaboré dans la justice sociale.’<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The
distinction was developed, he thinks, not from any philanthropic
motives but only because private vengeance was abolished
and the newly established power of the State sought thereby
to restrain the taste for blood. Now we may admit, with
Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> that the distinction is a late development in most
races whose social customs are known to us—for instance,
amongst the Germans, the Slavs, the Celts, the Scandinavians,
and the Ossetes. France does not seem to have recognised
the distinction in its written laws before <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 819. In feudal
England it does not make its appearance before the time of
Henry VIII.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> But Seebohm<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> shows that in the Lex
Wisigothorum (about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 650) ‘a homicide committed unknowingly
(<i>nesciens</i>) is declared to be ... no cause of death.
“Let the man who has committed it depart secure.”’ The
introduction of Roman law may have caused this innovation,
for Roman law admitted the distinction from the time of the
Twelve Tables<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> onwards, and this code was still operative
amongst Gallic peoples when they were conquered by the
Wisigoths.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> From <i>Beowulf</i>, however, Seebohm<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> infers
that in Scandinavia within the clan ‘accidental homicide does
not seem to be followed even by exile.’ The poem says<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>:
‘Hæthcyn by arrow from hornbow brought him (Herebeald)
down, his near kinsman. He missed the target and shot his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
brother. One brother killed the other with bloody dart. That
was a wrong past compensation.... Any way and every way
it was inevitable that the Etheling must quit life unavenged.’
In this case, of course, there could be no question of wergeld.</p>

<p>In the ‘Canones Wallici’<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> (Celtic laws of the period
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 700-800), which are based on the tribal wergeld system
as adopted by the Church, we find this clause: ‘Si quis homicidium
ex intentione commiserit, ancillas <span class="allsmcap">III</span> et servos <span class="allsmcap">III</span>
reddat.’ This implies a different penalty when murder was
not <i>ex intentione</i>.</p>

<p>The Brehon laws<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> contain minute distinctions of payment
in different cases of wounding. If a bishop’s blood was shed
in certain quantities, the guilty person had to be hanged or
to pay seven <i>cumhals</i> (slaves)—or their equivalent in silver
and gold: if a less quantity of blood was shed, the aggressor
was condemned to lose his hand. If the blood of a priest was
shed in certain quantities, the criminal’s hand was cut off or
seven <i>ancillae</i> paid, if the act was intentional; if it was not
intentional, one <i>ancilla</i> sufficed for compensation. It is clear
then that this distinction is not always absent even in a
wergeld system where the crime of bloodshed is particularly
objective. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> that wergeld often carried
with it an ‘honour-price,’ an atonement for the insult, which
was caused by homicide. This price, it seems to us, could
easily admit of a modification of the penalty. Moreover, it is
possible that wergeld is not always to be regarded as a
measure of the loss sustained by a clan, but as also to some
extent a ransom of the prisoner’s life. ‘Partout,’ says Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
‘la composition varie selon le rang de la victime: et selon le
rang du coupable: elle est à la fois la rançon du meurtrier et
le prix du sang versé.’ For the Germans, according to
Coulanges,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> ‘la composition est un rachat, non pas rachat
de la victime mais rachat de la vie du coupable.’<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Is it not
natural to suppose that a system of compensation for homicide
which contains such minute differentiations would leave the
road open for a discrimination as to degrees of guilt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>It is time to ask whether Homer has anything to say of
this distinction. We will admit that he says nothing which is
directly relevant to the question. But we will examine two
passages with a view to showing that the distinction was known
outside the Achaean caste.</p>

<p>The first passage is from the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and is concerned
with King Oedipus the parricide and with his punishment.
Odysseus narrates how, in Hades, he saw Epicaste, and how
‘he that had slain his father wedded her and straightway the
gods made known these things to men. Yet he abode in pain
in pleasant Thebes, ruling the Cadmeans, by reason of the
baneful devices of the gods. She indeed went down to
Hades ... but for him she left behind many a woe, such as
the Erinnyes of a mother bring to pass.’ Of all forms of
homicide, that by which a son deprived a parent of life was
regarded as the most horrible. Probably even the Achaeans,
as we shall see presently, felt a certain horror at the thought of
parricide. Homer, then, cannot understand why the gods,
who had taken the trouble of revealing the crimes of Oedipus,
nevertheless permitted, if they did not encourage, his continued
rule over the Cadmeans. All other parricides of whom Homer
had ever heard had taken to flight! And what was the pain
which Oedipus endured? Was it remorse of conscience? Or
was it his self-inflicted blindness? Euripides<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> tells how the
sons of Oedipus confined their father under bolts and hid him
away that his sad fate might be forgotten. We shall see,
later, when we analyse the Oedipodean legends as given by the
Attic dramatists, how Oedipus is filled with natural grief, but is
free from that sense of moral guilt which we should expect him
to have felt. He constantly pleads that he did not know that
the man whom he slew was Laius, his father. Was this plea
invented in later years, or was it part of the original legend?
Seebohm<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> has told us that in primitive clan societies ‘accidental
homicide within the kindred does not seem to be
followed even by exile.’ Was it, then, because of ‘accidental’
or involuntary<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> parricide that Oedipus continued to rule over
the Cadmeans? Oedipus was not an Achaean. Minoan or
Cadmean, which was he? It does not matter, for our purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
if he obeyed the ‘dooms’ of private vengeance in tribal society.
Homer is equally vague about the working of the mother’s
curse. Why did Epicaste curse Oedipus? The Attic dramatists
do not mention this. Oedipus is cursed in Homer for one reason,
and, as we think, for one reason only. It is because other
slayers of kinsmen who did not suffer punishment were usually
cursed. Thus Meleager, who in a quarrel slew his uncle, was
cursed by his mother Althaea.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> It is an Homeric maxim
that the Erinnyes command men to honour their parents.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The second passage which we shall cite is from the <i>Iliad</i>,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
a passage in which the ghost of Patroclus tells Achilles how his
father Menoitius brought him away from home to the realm
of Peleus on the day when he slew the son of Amphidamas,
though he was but a boy and did not intend it, and was angry
over dice.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> As this is the only passage in Homer which
contains an explicit reference to involuntary homicide, and
as the slayer is compelled to flee for ever precisely as if the act
had been wilful murder, this passage has been quoted<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> as
a proof that in early Greece there was no distinction made
between murder and manslaughter. If, however, we are
right in our discrimination between the Pelasgian and the
Achaean attitudes to homicide, it would almost seem as if the
passage could be regarded, not indeed as a proof, but perhaps
as an indication, of the existence of this distinction in Homeric
Greece. May we not suppose that the words of Patroclus are
not an expression of subjective innocence by a member of a
caste which regarded only objective facts, but a ‘reminiscence’
of a higher ethical code which obtained in the tribal villages
around the fortress, and which had enshrined itself in the language
which the Achaeans learned from the Pelasgians? In
the words of Patroclus we think we can find an echo of a distinction
which, in later times, is made the basis of grades of penalties
in certain laws of homicide. Plato, whose penal code is probably
modelled on the unwritten laws of tribal institutions,
points out that a person who slays another in a passion but with
intent to kill shall be exiled for a period of three years, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
a person who slays in a passion without intent to kill is punished
by exile for two years. He adds that ‘it is difficult to give
laws on such matters with accuracy.... Of all these matters,
therefore, let the guardians of the laws have cognisance ...
and let the exiles acquiesce in the decisions of such magistrates.’
We cannot, of course, ignore the main fact given by Homer
that Patroclus was compelled to flee from death because of
involuntary or quasi-involuntary homicide. But Patroclus
was an Achaean and we do not associate with the Achaeans
any tendency to discriminate between degrees of guilt. The
Achaean system of military control within a small dominant
caste was merely capable of preventing indefinite retaliations.
It was not interested in homicide as an offence against the
stability of social organisations. It had no homicide tribunals,
no elaborate code of penalties. We could not expect it to
manifest any subtle power of delicate discrimination. It is
possible that the military system of historical Sparta was
equally crude in its conceptions of homicide-guilt as it was,
apparently, equally severe in its punishment.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>We shall see, later,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> when we analyse the laws of Plato’s
homicide-code and of the ancient Hebrew code that the distinction
between voluntary and involuntary slaying was much
more likely to have arisen in the tribal customs of village-communities
accustomed to the most minute differentiations
in their wergeld system than in systems emanating from
centralised political or religious authority. The Homeric
poems give us, it is true, no reliable evidence which would
help us to arrive at a definite decision on the existence of such
a distinction in early Greece, but from the passages we have
cited we may at least extract a suggestion that the distinction
was really appreciated, and we have suggested a source from
which that sentiment may very easily have sprung.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Justifiable and Unjustifiable Homicide</span></h4>

<p>We come now to a kindred problem, namely, the question
whether the Pelasgians<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> were aware of a difference between
justifiable and non-justifiable slaying? Most writers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
will admit that there was no vengeance set in motion by
death on the field of battle. It was a recognised challenge
of strength, an ἄγων, the issue of which was accepted as the
will of the gods. But in local blood-vengeance, arising, let
us suppose, out of failure to pay wergeld, or when the
murderer’s clan defended him at home or did not expel him and
feud followed, was there no distinction between murder and
just revenge? Glotz, as we should expect, holds that there
was no distinction between murder and revenge.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> ‘Coupable
ou non coupable, il est responsable. Qui a versé du sang
doit du sang.’ It is thus, certainly, with modern Montenegrins,
Albanians and others. But are the creators of Mycenaean
civilisation to be compared with these? Glotz conceives the
blood-vengeance of early Greece to be what we have called
unrestricted vendetta, but this mode of vengeance is not
usually associated with settled tribal communities who are
otherwise known to accept wergeld, and we maintain that
the Pelasgians had reached this stage at the dawn of Greek
history. Glotz bases his view for the most part<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> on those
numerous ‘flights’ of murderers which Homer records. Now,
these references concern murderers, not avengers of murder;
and there is no instance, in Homer, of an avenger of blood
becoming in turn the object of vengeance. The non-Homeric
instances cited by Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> such as the trial of Ares for the
murder of Halirrhothius, who had dishonoured his daughter;
the flight of Hyettos from Argos to Orchomenus, after slaying
Molouros, who was caught in adultery with his wife, are derived
from Pausanias, Apollodorus, or Euripides, and are therefore
irrelevant for the interpretation of the Homeric age.</p>

<p>We admit, with Glotz, that in cases of adultery and
seduction slaying was unjustifiable in Homer which would
have been justifiable in historical Greece. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> points
out that the system of compensation for adultery and seduction
which is found in the laws of Gortyn recalls, in a certain manner,
the custom applied by Hephaestus to Ares in the <i>Odyssey</i>.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
He says of this system: ‘Nous y retrouvons aussi, exprimées
avec précision, quelques-unes des règles que les coutumes ont
transmises aux législations<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.... Entre la ποινή de Gortyne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
et celle de la fin des temps Homériques la ressemblance est
frappante.’<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> This is as much as to say that ‘towards the
close of the Homeric epoch’ custom (or, as we should say, tribal
unwritten law) compelled the husband of an adulterous wife
to accept, in certain cases, compensation from the paramour,
and to arrest, but not to slay him. In the <i>Odyssey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Hephaestus, having surprised Ares in the arms of his wife,
decides to imprison them, saying ‘the snare and the bond will
hold them till her sire give back to me the gifts of wooing.’
The other gods, among whom ‘laughter unquenchable arose,’
say that ‘Ares owes the adulterer’s fine’ (μοιχάγρι’ ὀφέλλει).
In the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> the wife of Proetus falsely accused Bellerophon
of attempted adultery,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and begged her husband to slay the
offender. But Homer tells us that Proetus feared to slay
him, and sent him forth to Lycia with the famous σήματα
λυγρά—a written injunction to the King of Lycia to put
Bellerophon to death—an act which suggests that the death
penalty for adultery was not customary in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> And
surely the existence of a prescribed μοιχάγρια suggests that
even amongst the Achaeans the slaying of an adulterer was
unjustifiable. We may further infer that amongst the
Pelasgians there existed some authority, whether tribal
tradition, or clan-custom, which discriminated between the
cases in which death could and those in which it could not be
inflicted with impunity. The collective execution of death
in case of refusal to obey clan-laws regarding the payment
of wergeld, or μοιχάγρια, is a clear manifestation of that
social justice which claims the right to decide between justifiable
and unjustifiable slaying.</p>

<p>We cannot, of course, find any evidence in the Homeric
poems for a tabulation of instances of justifiable homicide
such as is found in the laws of Dracon.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> But the Homeric
poems present us with a picture which is mainly, if not exclusively,
Achaean, and we cannot infer from the absence of
Homeric evidence that the Pelasgian tribes which had developed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
as we think,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> a capacity for discriminating between
degrees of homicide guilt, had not also evolved a definite
conception of the distinction between just and unjust slaying.
We shall see<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> later that even the Achaeans recognised at
least a distinction between murder and just revenge. Thus,
the Achaean Orestes who slew his mother to avenge his father
is said by Homer to have ‘gained renown amongst all men.’<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
In the <i>Odyssey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Amphinomus, one of the suitors, refuses to
join a conspiracy to murder Telemachus without consulting
the gods: ‘I for one would not choose to kill Telemachus:
it is a fearful thing to slay one of the stock of kings: nay,
first let us seek the counsel of the gods, and if the oracles
(θέμιστες) of great Zeus approve, myself I will slay him and
bid all the rest to aid; but if the gods are disposed to avert it,
I bid you, too, refrain.’ The θέμιστες here attributed to Zeus
must be regarded as a reflex of the public opinion of the
Achaean caste, which, therefore, had evolved a distinction
between just and unjust slaying. In another place<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Eupeithes, the father of a slain suitor, says ‘It is a scorn if we
avenge not ourselves on the slayers of our sons and brothers;
rather would I die!’ It is obvious that an act which is a
duty prescribed by caste or law or custom cannot be regarded
as a crime. So,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> when the feud arose between Odysseus,
who regarded himself as justified in slaying the suitors who had
insulted his family, and the suitors, who were contriving what
they considered a just revenge, Homer tells us that Odysseus
would have slain them all, had not Athene intervened and
ordered both sides to desist and to enter into a solemn covenant
of reconciliation. This act of Athene<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> signifies that in her
opinion both sides are justified in shedding blood, and hence
that the feud can be cancelled without disturbing the balance
of justice. Now Glotz<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> rightly points out that the ancients
attributed to their gods such opinions as they themselves
professed; and if Achaeanised Athene acted thus, how can
we avoid assuming the existence of at least as high a standard
amongst the Pelasgians? In Homer then we may conclude
that there existed some distinction between just and unjust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
slaying. For Glotz, this distinction arises only when the State
takes justice into its own hands and legitimatises private
vengeance after trial. The date of this evolution, he thinks,
is the age of Dracon. But we maintain that, long before
Dracon, or perhaps even before Homer, there existed, in
Greece, States within States, that is, clans and tribes and
phratries, whose interest it was, at the dawn of civilised society,
to create the distinction between justifiable and unjustifiable
bloodshed, which is so vital to domestic peace.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Collectivity in Vengeance</span></h4>

<p>Nothing that has been said in this chapter is incompatible
with the view that punishment, in early societies, tends to be
collective and hereditary. Feuds of blood must have occasionally
occurred amongst the early Pelasgian folk, but we cannot
ignore the control of tribal authority, and the Achaean domination
which may have acted as a check. However, it is one
thing to declare war on a group which refuses to fulfil the law
of a district or of a tribe; it is quite another thing to refuse
the ‘satisfaction’ prescribed by custom, and to make a single
murder an invariable cause of incessant bloodshed. This is
the state of Homeric society as conceived by Glotz, and by
most writers on the subject of early Greek homicide. We prefer
to emphasise the triumph of reason over passion which is
symbolised by a wergeld system of local vengeance, by the
worship of common ancestors, real or fictitious, by the early
political synoekism of many Greek districts, and by international
Amphictyonies of immemorial antiquity. We think
that it was in post-Homeric times, when the Achaean control
was removed, and the Migrations broke up the solidarity of
Pelasgian clans, that Greek societies developed unrestricted
vendetta. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> has difficulties about the Homeric age.
He has to admit that there is no infallible system of
collective punishment in Homer. ‘Dans l’Iliade et dans
l’Odyssée,’ he says, ‘les querelles strictement personnelles ne
lient plus infailliblement au sort de l’offenseur tous les siens.
On n’y voit point, après un meurtre ἐμφύλιος, les vengeurs du
sang poursuivre la famille du meurtrier.’ The difficulty is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
obviated by our theory of Achaean restricted vendetta. The
vengeance of Achilles<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> for the death of Patroclus is no objection
to our theory, as it is not revenge for homicide proper: war
is distinct from peace. Achaean kings confiscate property,
transfer and destroy whole cities<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>: this is but the autocracy
of a quasi-feudal militarism; it is not a punishment of moral
guilt.</p>

<p>Euripides<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> makes Tyndareus utter a sentiment regarding
the legitimate modes of homicide-vengeance which seems to
us to be very applicable to early Greek societies. Tyndareus
objects to the infliction of death as a penalty for the slaying
of Agamemnon, on the ground that such penalties, in the
absence of State-control, would inevitably lead to an indefinite
series of retaliations. ‘Right well,’ he says, ‘did our ancestors
in olden times enact these ordinances ... they punished (the
murderer) with exile, but they suffered no one to slay him in
return, for (in that eventuality) each successive avenger would
be liable for bloodshed.... I will support the law, and try
to check this brutal murderous practice destructive alike of
individual States and of the world.’ We shall see later<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
that Euripides is either consciously archaising in this passage
or that the view of Tyndareus was somehow preserved in the
legend which the dramatist follows. In either case, it seems
to us to contain a valuable principle regarding the fear of
unrestricted vendetta, of collective and hereditary punishment,
which is found in civilised tribal societies in a condition of
private vengeance. Such societies have either to abandon
civilisation, and to fall back into a chronic state of chaotic
barbarism, or to adopt a system of ‘social justice’ which, by
definite rules and regulations, expressive of tribal authority,
by public opinion and religious sanctions, prevents, as far as
possible, the innocent from suffering with the guilty.</p>

<p>The penalty of wergeld was, in a certain sense, collective
because it was diffused throughout the kindred. But this
penalty is clearly far removed from the collective punishment
of a barbarous hypervengeance. It arises, we have said, from
the simple fact that property, in early society, was to a great
extent collective or common; and also from the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
individual of tribal life was not the isolated personality
which feudal and modern civilisations have evolved, but was
rather a branch of one great wide-spreading tree in which he
lived and moved and had his being. Finally, in regard to the
Homeric society, we must remember that the Achaeans stood
on quite a separate plane. Amongst them there is little or no
suggestion of collective punishment. Achaean military discipline
prevented it. Such traces of this punishment as are found
in many later legends must be attributed, as we shall see,
to post-Homeric influences.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ACHAEAN SYSTEM</span></h3>

<p>Achaean system explained according to author’s theory: proofs from Homeric
text: question of discrimination, amongst Achaeans, between murder
and manslaughter, and between justifiable and unjustifiable homicide:
no collectivity or solidarity in vengeance.</p>

</div>

<p>‘The Achaians,’ says Leaf,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ‘shew no signs in Homer of
anything corresponding to the minor classifications, so important
in later Greece, which is recalled to us by the Attic names
of γένος and φρατρία. They appear as a single unit divided
only locally. The whole primitive family system, with its
rites and taboos, has disappeared and the only kinship recognised
as carrying a moral obligation is the natural obligation
of close blood relationship ... this is only what we should
expect in a people of military adventurers.... Homicide is a
local and family affair.’</p>

<p>We have indicated the confusion of ideas which characterises
the traditional views regarding Homeric homicide,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a confusion
which is to be attributed to the failure of writers to discriminate
between the Achaeans and the Pelasgians, between
the individualistic quasi-feudal militarism of a dominant caste
and the complex tribal organisations of a settled agricultural
subject-people. We have suggested, as the most probable hypothesis,
that the Pelasgian penalty for homicide was normally
and essentially wergeld, except in cases of kin-slaying, for
which the penalty was exile: we have argued that, within the
Pelasgian tribe, or phratry, or village community, exile from
his clan or phratry or State was accepted for the slayer as a
complete or partial substitute for his wergeld debt: and
that if the murderer in default of wergeld remained in his
native place beyond a certain time, he could be killed with
impunity, having been previously warned or threatened;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
we have said that bondage or servitude might be accepted in
case of failure to pay the prescribed wergeld quota—whether
on the part of the murderer himself or on the part of delinquent
relatives—a bondage which was not necessarily perpetual, but
was rather a temporary punishment proportioned to the ‘debt.’
The Achaean system, we have suggested,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was fundamentally
different: it was a restricted ‘small family’ vendetta, in which
blood for blood was the normal retribution, wergeld was
unknown, and exile was merely a flight from death.</p>

<p>This view must now be defended from the text of Homer.
In the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we read that there came as a suppliant to Telemachus,
at Pylos, a murderer from Argos, named Theoclymenus.
He was a great-grandson of Melampus who was a contemporary
of Nestor, and the family had been settled in Argos for
four generations.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That the family was Achaean is rendered
obvious by the Homeric text.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> That the victim was probably
a kinsman of the murderer appears from the words ἄνδρα
ἔμφυλον.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We pointed out, in the Introduction,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> how easily
relatives could have accumulated in one or two hundred years,
without, however, attaining to the reality, whatever may be
said about the appearance, of a clan. But the important
point to note is that, even in exile, Theoclymenus feared the
death which was desired by those who were at once akin to him
and to his victim. ‘I have fled,’ he says, ‘from my country,
for the manslaying of one of mine own kin; and many brothers
and kinsmen of the slain are in Argos ... and rule mightily
over the Achaeans. Wherefore now am I an exile to shun death
and the black fate at their hands.... Set me on board ship
since I supplicate thee in my flight, lest they slay me utterly:
for methinks they follow hard after me.’<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Nothing could be
farther removed than this from the recognised exile penalty of
the wergeld system. The passage shows, moreover, that the
supplication was not an appeal for homicide-purgation, as
Müller would maintain<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>—we shall see later that this ceremonial
was post-Homeric—but was merely an appeal for protection
from the avengers of blood.</p>

<p>A similar supplication is mentioned in a passage in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
<i>Iliad</i>,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in which we read that ‘Epeigeus, who ruled fair-set
Boudeion of old, when he had slain a good man of his kin, came
as suppliant to Peleus and silver-footed Thetis ... and they
sent him to follow with Achilles.’ The locality of Boudeion
is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> While we cannot argue that Epeigeus was an
Achaean from the fact that he is included amongst the Myrmidons
(after his adoption by Peleus), still we may presume that
he was an Achaean from the behaviour of Peleus and hence we
may interpret his exile as a flight from death. We may therefore
infer that death was the Achaean penalty for kin-slaying.
This passage also illustrates the statement of Leaf<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that
homicide, among Achaeans, brings no disability other than exile
from home. To an ambitious young man ‘exile under such
circumstances is no punishment: a wealthy and generous king
can give opportunities of advancement beyond all the hopes of
a narrow family circle.’ Epeigeus, as Homer tells us,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> was
slain by Hector in battle before the walls of Troy. His enrolment
among the Myrmidons saved him from the hands of the
avengers of blood.</p>

<p>In another passage of the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> we are told that Medon,
son of Oileus and brother of Ajax, ‘dwelt in Phylace, far from
his own country, for that he had slain a man, the brother of his
stepmother Eriopis.’ The murder probably took place in Opus,
a Locrian town, where also was perpetrated the death of the son
of Amphidamas at the hands of Patroclus.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Like Patroclus,
Medon came to Phthia, not to Peleus the king of the realm,
but only, as Leaf would maintain,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to Protesilaus, a ‘baron’
of Achilles who ruled the town of Phylace. The typically
Achaean method of procedure is maintained.</p>

<p>Again, we are told<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that Lycophron, son of Mastor, of
Cythera, slew a man in Cythera and came and dwelt with Ajax
who made him his ‘squire’ or a member of his bodyguard.
He, too, was slain in Troy, and when he falls Ajax says to his
brother Teucer, ‘Our faithful comrade has fallen ... whom
we honoured like our parents.’ Leaf<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> quotes this passage as
an instance of the immunity of Achaeans from any real punishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
for bloodshed. So far as tribal customs were concerned
such men were entirely above the law.</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Eumaeus, swineherd of Odysseus, tells
how a beggar appealed to him for help on the ground that he
had slain a man, and that he knew Odysseus (which was a
falsehood). From the poverty of the beggar it is not necessary
to infer that he was a Pelasgian who had ‘wandered over a
vast tract of land.’</p>

<p>Again, Odysseus,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> inventing a fiction about his past,
pretends that he is a murder-refugee from Crete (an Achaean
dominion), having killed the son of Idomeneus. ‘I smote him,’
he says, ‘with a bronze-shod spear as he came home from the
field, lying in ambush for him by the wayside, with one of my
companions.’ He adds, very significantly, as we think: ‘and
now I have come hither with these my goods; and I left as
much again to my children.’ There is no trace here of that
solidarity in the control of property, and of that ‘passive collectivity’
or distribution of punishment, which is so characteristic
of clan wergeld. No tribal murderer could have taken any
property away with him: his property, and therefore probably<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
that of his children, was distributed among the wider kindred
who either retained it or used it to defray their share of the
wergeld.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Odysseus, however, departs with half his property,
and the relatives of the slain Orsilochus left the children
in tranquil enjoyment of the rest! Of course, Odysseus did
not really live through such an experience, but a ‘tribesman’
would have told a very different story.</p>

<p>Again, there is the story of Phoenix,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which opens up the
question of parricide. Phoenix did not kill his father, but it
occurred to him to do so, because his father cursed him with
sterility, for having had amorous relations with one of his
father’s concubines. Fearing to commit the dread deed of
parricide, he decided to leave his home. His relatives and
comrades endeavoured to dissuade him, holding a feast in his
house for nine days, but on the tenth he fled. He went from
Hellas to Phthia, to King Peleus, who made him king over the
Dolopians. A portion of this passage<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has been considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
spurious by many editors, as it is not found in any Homeric
manuscript, and Aristarchus is said by Plutarch to have
omitted it, as being unsuitable to the character of Phoenix<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>;
Glotz<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> holds that the feast in question was a kind of gathering
of the clan. The father, he thinks, wished to banish the son,
but could not do so without the solemn and formal ratification
of the assembled clan. He says of Amyntor,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the father
of Phoenix: ‘Comme Thésée, il a maudit son fils: s’il ne le
bannit pas, comme Thésée, c’est qu’il a besoin d’obtenir le
consentement du γένος.’ Now Euripides<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in describing the
curse which Theseus pronounced against his son, Hippolytus,
whom he believed to be the real though not the actual cause
of the death of his wife Phaedra the step-mother of Hippolytus,
tells us also that Theseus commanded Hippolytus to
depart from Troizen and forbade him ever to reside at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
This sentence was pronounced without any consultation with
the clans of tribal Attica, because Theseus, in the legends, is
erroneously presented as an autocratic ruler, like Peisistratus,
rather than as a tribal chieftain. But Amyntor was an
Achaean, and we have argued that the Achaeans did not acknowledge
or recognise clan-jurisdiction. Hence, a comparison of
Amyntor with the legendary Theseus is logically valid but
does not justify Glotz’s conclusions. Moreover, if it had been
the desire of Amyntor to secure a formal decree from the
clan for the expulsion of his son, why should the ‘clan’ have
guarded Phoenix as if he were a prisoner? Surely it would
have been sufficient to obtain a decree of banishment after the
offender had fled. On this point, Glotz does not seem quite
clear. ‘Sans doute,’ he says, ‘tous ses parents montent la
garde autour de Phoenix de peur qu’il ne s’échappe. Mais
ce n’est pas pour cela qu’ils sont venus. Ils sont venus sur
convocation.’ But we can find no suggestion, in Homer, that
the kinsmen were summoned by Amyntor to agree to a
sentence of banishment for his son. We are told quite plainly
that Amyntor and his son were exceedingly angry with each
other, so much so that Phoenix contemplated parricide, and
would have killed his father had not some of the immortals
reminded him of the unpleasant reputation which the act<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
would bring him.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Owing to his father’s curse, he looked
forward to a childless old age. He tells us that he decided
to leave his home.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> For an Achaean such an exile involved
no serious hardship, but might, on the contrary, have brought
many advantages. His relatives came, as we think, to entreat
and restrain him.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> They ‘imprisoned’ him, or rather they
sought to prevent his escape, in the hope that the feast would
reconcile the father and the son. Can we imagine a group of
clan-kindred, with a right of inheritance to the property of
Phoenix, so very anxious to restrain him? We fear they would
rather have celebrated his departure! But Homer makes no
mention of clan-kindred. The ἔται and the ἀνεψιοί are the
ordinary ‘comrades and cousins’ of the Achaean ‘small family
circle’: the whole context supports the hypothesis of Leaf,
of which Glotz is unaware, namely that the Achaeans of Homer
lived in an atmosphere which is foreign to the clan.</p>

<p>The question remains: what was the consequential penalty
which helped to deter the Achaean Phoenix, who had otherwise
little regard for his father, from actually slaying him? We
have seen<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that kin-slaying, and therefore parricide, was
punished by exile in the tribal system. How would it have
been punished within the Achaean caste? We have little
Homeric evidence to guide us here. Homicide amongst the
Achaeans is a private affair which concerns a small family
circle. In the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the Trojan Akamas says that it is
desirable for a man to pray that ‘some kinsman be left in his
home to avenge his fall.’ If Akamas avenges the slaying of his
brother even in war, will a son not avenge the slaying of a
father? Does not Orestes avenge the murder of his father, Agamemnon,
even when that vengeance necessitates the shedding
of his mother’s blood? Homer implies that Clytaemnestra
was the murderer of Agamemnon and also of Cassandra<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>: he
also implies that she was slain by her son Orestes.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Glotz<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
regards such vengeance as perfectly normal: ‘Loin d’être
impossible,’ he says, ‘la repression des crimes commis par un
parent contre un parent est plus certaine et plus sévère que la
réparation des dommages causés par une famille à une autre.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Si l’offenseur ... est parent de la victime ses auxiliaires
naturels deviennent ses ennemis. Seul, il a contre lui l’univers.’
Hence it is probable that the ἔται and the ἀνεψιοί who were so
anxious to heal the feud between Amyntor and his son<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> would
have been equally anxious to avenge Amyntor if he had been
slain by Phoenix. They would have put the parricide to death.</p>

<p>The portion of the Homeric story of Phoenix which is
generally regarded as spurious<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> happens to be the passage in
which parricide is referred to in a casual and frivolous manner.
Plutarch states that such a reference was considered unsuitable
to the character of Phoenix. We will go further and say that
it is unsuitable to the ancient Greek conception of parricide,
whether among the Achaeans, or, <i>a fortiori</i>, among the clans.
This latter point will become more evident when we discuss the
laws of Plato and the legends of the Attic tragedians. Our
theory of the Achaean penalty for homicide must now seek
further confirmation from a discussion of other Homeric
passages.</p>

<p>In the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Phoenix tells Achilles the story of Meleager,
son of Oeneus, King of Calydon, pointing out how he refused
to fight for his people during a war between the Calydonians
and the Curetes. The cause of his refusal was his indignation
at the curse which his mother, Althaea, had launched against
him because he had slain her brother, a prince of the Curetes,
in the war. Homer, of course, does not mention the story which
later legends contain, of the fateful brand, and the death of
Meleager when the brand was burned by his mother.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But
from the entreaties of his father, Oeneus, of his sisters, and
even of his mother,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and from the presents which were offered
to him by the priests and the elders of the Aetolians,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in the
hope that he would lay aside his anger and continue to fight
for the Calydonians, we may infer that he was not regarded
in Homeric times as a kin-slayer of certain guilt. His own
anger, too, indicates what the Homeric facts would seem to
imply, that the slaying of his mother’s brother was in his own
opinion justifiable as an act of war.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>When, in later times, the Roman poet Ovid makes Althaea
say, as the Achaean avenger of a brother’s death would naturally
say, <i>mors morte pianda est</i>, he implies, what the Homeric story
of the ‘curse’ compels us to assume, that Althaea regarded
her brother’s death as culpable kin-slaying, which required
atonement. The curse of Althaea indicates her conviction
that the death of Thestius was a crime and also her inability
to avenge it at the time. But, in the general opinion, there
was a doubt about the guilt of Meleager, and Meleager was
sufficiently important to get the benefit of the doubt. There
are, then, two conclusions which may be indirectly derived
from this passage: (<i>a</i>) that kin-slaying, within the Achaean
caste, was regarded as a crime which merited serious punishment,
such as death; and (<i>b</i>) that the distinction between
justifiable and unjustifiable slaying was in certain circumstances
admitted and upheld by the Achaeans.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Our next quotation has reference to Tydeus, the brother
of Meleager. Homer<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> tells us that Tydeus left his native
Calydon, and ‘roaming thence settled at Argos, (for thus did
Zeus and other gods decree,) and married there a daughter
of Adrastus.’ In this connexion Leaf<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> points out that
‘Homer does not tell of any actual homicide, yet the picture
he gives of the family feuds in Tydeus’ time is such as to make
family bloodshed far from improbable.’ From later legends<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
we learn what Homer has not mentioned, namely, that Tydeus
was a kin-slayer. We know that Tydeus was an Achaean,
and his action in fleeing from Calydon and settling at Argos
was a typical Achaean procedure. His ‘exile’ was really a
flight from death, and such a flight suggests that even in the
case of kin-slaying the Achaeans, unlike the Pelasgians, did not
accept ‘exile’ as a penalty for bloodshed. This has already
been demonstrated in connexion with the flight of Theoclymenus.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The alliance of Tydeus, by marriage, with Adrastus,
King of Argos, helped to preclude the possibility of blood-vengeance
at the hands of Calydonian avengers.</p>

<p>A clear and cogent illustration of the Achaean system of
avenging bloodshed is to be found in the punishment inflicted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
by Orestes on his mother and her paramour in revenge for
the slaying of Agamemnon. It is not of course a matter of
absolute certainty that Orestes slew his mother or that she
slew her husband, in the Homeric story, but it can, we think,
be inferred with the greatest probability. Homer says<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
that, after the Trojan war, Menelaus wandered about with his
ships ‘amongst men of strange speech’ for seven years: that
meanwhile ‘Aegisthus planned baneful deeds at home: and
for seven years ruled over rich Mycenae, having wrought the
death of the son of Atreus, and subdued unto himself the
people: but in the eighth year goodly Orestes came back from
Athens as a retribution and slew the man guilty of his father’s
blood (πατροφονῆα), Aegisthus of crafty counsel, who had
wrought his father’s death. Now when he had slain him, he
held a funeral feast with the Argives for his hateful mother
and for Aegisthus powerless in defence (ἀνάλκιδος).’ In this
rendering of the text, we have deliberately avoided translating
κτείνειν as ‘to slay,’ since it can also mean ‘to seek to slay’<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
or, which is almost equivalent, ‘to plot the death of.’ From
the point of view of homicide-guilt and retribution, the plotter
and the perpetrator were probably equally culpable whether
in the Homeric epoch or in historical times.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Hence it is
that in other passages Homer presents Clytaemnestra as the
plotter and Aegisthus as the executor. In both cases, of course,
the guilt of bloodshed is aggravated by the additional stigma
of adultery. In the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Zeus tells how he warned
Aegisthus not to kill Agamemnon or to woo his wife, for
Agamemnon would be avenged by Orestes. Again,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> we are
told that Aegisthus brought Clytaemnestra to his house—‘a
willing lover and a willing lady.’ In another passage<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> we
hear of the famous scout whom Aegisthus placed in a tower,
to watch for the homecoming of Agamemnon. This scout
had been watching for the space of a year<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> when Agamemnon
arrived. Immediately upon his arrival, he accepted an
invitation to a feast in the house of Aegisthus, who had prepared
an ambush to destroy him in the event of his refusal.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[58]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
After the feast he was slain ‘as one slayeth an ox at the stall’;
but not without a struggle. ‘None of the “companions”
of the son of Atreus who attended him survived, nor any of
the “companions” of Aegisthus, but they were slain in the
house.’<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> We have pointed out that Clytaemnestra was
living in this house with her paramour. The reference to the
time of the deed—‘after the feast’—and to the manner of
the slaying—‘as one slayeth an ox’—suggests the use of the
axe and the fatal bath of Agamemnon which has been made
so familiar by the Attic tragedians. We are definitely informed<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
that Clytaemnestra was an active agent in the terrible
bloodshed which took place. The ghost of Agamemnon speaking
to Odysseus in Hades says: ‘Aegisthus contrived my
death and doom and slew me, aided by my accursed wife ...
most pitiful of all I heard was the voice of Cassandra, daughter
of Priam, whom, close to me, the guileful Clytaemnestra slew.
As I was dying I strove to raise my hands to avert (or grasp)<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
the sword, but let them fall to the ground again, and that
shameless woman turned her back, nor could she bring herself,
even when I was going to the house of Hades, to close my eyes
or my mouth with her hands! Surely there is nought more
horrible and shameless than a woman since she planned
a foul deed, and wrought the death of her wedded lord.’
Aeschylus, then, as we think, has kept very closely to the
Homeric narrative, when, in the <i>Agamemnon</i>, he makes
Clytaemnestra the actual slayer of her husband, and represents
Aegisthus as concerning himself only with an ambush and
a battle against the retainers of Agamemnon. In Homer,
Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra were equally guilty. Orestes,
therefore, slays them both, and gains renown among all men.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
In the clan-system, Aegisthus, a first cousin of Agamemnon,
would not have been slain, if he had gone into exile, nor
would wergeld have been payable, as he was akin to the victim.
Clytaemnestra’s kindred might have compensated the crime
by a wergeld paid to the kindred of Agamemnon. How
strange it seems that the children of Aegisthus would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
received a share! In historical Athens, Aegisthus would
most probably have been put to death without the option of
exile, since he was a kin-slayer, while Clytaemnestra could have
gone into exile on the second day of the trial.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> To the minds
of post-Homeric legend-makers it would have been necessary
for Orestes,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> if he wished to be unimpeachably correct, to
obtain authority from the war-council of the chieftains, as
Menelaus did in the case of Helen<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; but in Homer Orestes is
the natural avenger of a crime which would otherwise have gone
unpunished. The slaying of Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra was
not murder, but just revenge, so far as that distinction was
admitted and sanctioned by the traditions and public opinion
of the Achaean caste. If there had been any tendency to
revolt at the abhorrent nature of Orestes’ act in slaying two
of his kindred—one of them the dearest of kin—this feeling
would have perished on the recollection that Aegisthus and
Clytaemnestra were not only murderers but adulterers. We
find evidence of a strong public opinion against this twofold
moral stigma in Homer. In the <i>Odyssey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> for instance,
Athene urges Telemachus to slay the suitors and quotes the
act of Orestes as a parallel. The point of the comparison lies
in the suggestion of adultery which attaches to the presence
of the suitors in the home of Odysseus. ‘Hast thou not heard,’
says Athene, ‘what renown the goodly Orestes gat him among
all men in that he slew the slayer of his father?... thou,
too, my friend ... be valiant, that even men unborn will
praise thee.’ But as we have elsewhere argued<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that
adultery alone would not justify, in private vengeance, the
death of the offender, we must conclude that the justification
for Orestes’ act consisted essentially in the fact that he avenged
the murder of his father. From this episode we may, then, also
conclude that the Achaeans, in certain circumstances, admitted
the distinction between justified and unjustified homicide.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>We have now adduced sufficient evidence from the Homeric
poems to justify the theory which we have propounded as to
the nature of Achaean blood-vengeance, and to illustrate the
contrast which it is necessary to make between the attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to homicide adopted by a temporary dominant caste of a
military quasi-feudal type and that of the tribal village communities
in which we believe the Pelasgian subject-race to
have lived. It remains for us to conclude this chapter by some
brief remarks on certain questions which we have already
raised and partly answered: <i>e.g.</i>, whether there existed, in
the Achaean caste, (<i>a</i>) the distinction between murder and
manslaughter, (<i>b</i>) the distinction between justified and unjustified
slaying, (<i>c</i>) the practice of collective and hereditary
vendetta.</p>

<p>In regard to the first question, we have argued<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> that a
legend as old as Homer must have presented as ‘involuntary’
the slaying of Laius by Oedipus. By this we mean that Oedipus
neither intended to kill the old man whom he met at the ‘crossing
of the three roads,’ nor was aware that the man whom he
slew was his father. If we now assume that the Achaeans
recognised no distinction between voluntary and involuntary
slaying, and that Homer lived in such an atmosphere, though
the language and the social system of the Pelasgian people
who lived around him were familiar with this distinction, we
can more easily understand the astonishment which the poet
seems to feel at the sojourn of Oedipus at Thebes after the
gods ‘made known these things to men.’ We can also, on this
assumption, more easily explain<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> the protest which is implicit
in the words of the dead Patroclus to Achilles when he describes
his flight from death ‘on the day when’ he slew the son of
Amphidamas, ‘being a mere stripling and not intending
(to kill) and being angered over (a game of) dice.’ If we add
to these probabilities the fact that the Achaeans were men of
a proud and haughty spirit, men of quick passions, and accustomed
to bloodshed, men who knew no restraint beyond that
of a temporary military discipline, and no fear of any greater
punishment than that of expulsion from a fortress or from the
councils of a military clique, we shall conclude that the distinction
between voluntary and involuntary slaying was not
recognised by the Achaeans. Such a conclusion incidentally
explains the general view of modern scholars<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that in the
Homeric epoch no such distinction was admissible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>In regard to the second question, concerning the distinction
between just and unjust slaying amongst the Achaeans, we
have indicated some evidence for this distinction in the public
approval which greeted the vengeance of Orestes,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> in the
sentiments of the Aetolians concerning Meleager,<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in the
scruples felt by one of the suitors in regard to a conspiracy
against the life of Telemachus,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> in the approval given by
Eupeithes,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and also, apparently, by the goddess Athene,<a id="FNanchor_354b" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
to the vengeance plotted for the slaying of the suitors. A
distinction between the indiscriminate slaying of enemies
which was permitted in war and the personal vendetta which
was restricted to the person of the murderer, in peace, is
illustrated by the contrast with normal modes of vengeance
exhibited by the act of Akamas who avenged his brother’s
death on Promachos, and not on Ajax, the actual slayer.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> says that before the time of Theseus, and the
establishment of the Delphinium court, there was no distinction
between just and unjust slaying, and that ‘every
manslayer had to flee for his life.’ This statement does not
altogether harmonise with our conception of Homeric Greece.
It does not take into account the control of Pelasgian tribes
and the influence of public opinion amongst the Achaeans.
His remarks are, we think, much more appropriate to the
post-Homeric period when society was in a state of disintegration.
Yet in regard to the Achaeans, we must point out
that their sentiments or ideals of vengeance may not always
have coincided with their acts. The arbitrariness of military
control, the presence of subjects outside the caste, the necessity
felt by the Achaeans of supporting their own side in every
dispute, make the period of their domination an epoch to which
the words of Pausanias are not entirely inapplicable.</p>

<p>Finally, if one asks whether the Achaeans practised a collective
and hereditary vendetta, we may reply that the nature
of the Achaean system of life, their consciousness of the paucity
of their numbers in the midst of potentially hostile people,
would have hindered any tendency to such a practice within
the Achaean caste. An insult inflicted from without provoked,
of course, the most savage retaliation. ‘Frightfulness,’ no less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
than military skill and strategic control, was one of the pillars
of the Achaean fabric of power. But we have seen how Athene
interfered to prevent the Achaean feud in the realm of Odysseus;
in this rôle of peace-maker she may be regarded as a symbol
of the restraining influence of military discipline and group-consciousness
amongst the Achaeans. From certain passages
in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in which there appears a kind of proverb, namely
that a man is lucky to have a son or brother to avenge his fall,
we may conclude that the danger of collective hypervengeance
occurring amongst the Achaeans was much less probable than
the danger of not being avenged at all. Similarly, in the
<i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> we are told that an Achaean murderer had no fear
that vengeance would fall upon his children. Thus, it is only
in post-Homeric times, we think, that the Greeks lapsed into
savagery and practised on a large scale a collective and
hereditary vendetta. This will be still more manifest when
we come to give an account of the Hesiodic society. From such
a state of chaos the Greeks were saved by the seventh-century
Apolline doctrine of pollution, which we shall describe in our
Second Book, and also by the evolution of democratic civic
government. When the State assumed responsibility for the
trial and execution of criminals, including murderers, the lust
of vengeance was gradually subdued. But all the more must
we admire the comparative absence of collective and hereditary
vendetta in the Homeric epoch, when, for Achaeans as well as
for Pelasgians, the execution of vengeance devolved upon the
relatives of the slain.</p>

<span class="smaller">JUDICIAL ASPECT OF HOMICIDE IN EARLY GREECE</span></h3>

<p>Current views criticised: author’s theory based on distinction between Achaean
and Pelasgian societies: arguments from survivals in historical times:
meaning of δικασπόλοι βασιλῆες: the Trial-Scene in the Homeric Shield
of Achilles: origin of trials for homicide.</p>

</div>

<p>In discussing the trial-scene which is found in Homer’s description
of the Shield of Achilles,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we were compelled incidentally
to give, in anticipation, the main results of our inquiries as to
the existence, in Homeric Greece, of tribunals for the trial of
homicide. Previous writers on the subject, who are unaware of
the differences in the organisation and nature of Pelasgian and
Achaean societies, have naturally maintained that homicide in
early Greece was entirely a ‘private’ affair and that trials
for homicide only arose when a post-Homeric conception of
murder as a ‘pollution’ compelled an investigation on the
part of kings and nobles who were anxious to avert the wrath
of the gods. Thus Bury says<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: ‘This notion of manslaughter
[<i>i.e.</i> homicide] as a religious offence necessarily led to the interference
of the State. For when the member of a community
was impure, the stain drew down the anger of the gods upon
the whole community, if the unclean were not driven out.
Hence it came about that the State undertook the conduct
of criminal justice.’ Jevons<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> propounds a similar view,
though he apparently finds more difficulties in the Homeric
text. ‘There was, indeed,’ he says, ‘no State power to which
the relatives of the deceased could appeal for redress, much
less was there any State power which of its own motion undertook
to apprehend and punish the murderer. But in Homeric
times a feeling was gathering that murder was an offence
against the members of the community in their collective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
capacity.’ Bury’s general view-point is that homicide was the
only crime which called for State interference, and that there
was no such interference before the doctrine of pollution arose.
Other ‘crimes,’ he thinks, continued to be ‘private’ affairs
until the centralisation of government brought it about that
the injured party, before punishing the offenders, had to seek
State authorisation in the form of trial, but in such cases the
State never acted on its own initiative or responsibility.
‘It must be borne in mind,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ‘that, in old days, deeds
which injured only the individual and did not touch the gods
or the State were left to the injured person to deal with as he
chose or could. The State did not interfere. Even in the
case of blood-shedding it devolved upon the kinsfolk of the
slain man to wreak punishment upon the slayer. Then, as
social order developed along with centralisation, the State took
justice partly into its own hands: and the injured man,
before he could punish the wrong-doer, was obliged to charge
him before a judge, who decided the punishment. But it
must be noted that no crime could come before a judge unless
the injured person came forward as accuser. The case of
blood-shedding was exceptional, owing to the religious ideas
connected with it. It was felt that the shedder of blood was
not only impure himself, but had also defiled the gods of the
community: so that, as a consequence of this theory, manslaughter
of every form came under the class of crimes
against the religion of the State.’ Bury does not define precisely
the time at which homicide became a religious offence,
but from this and other references we assume that he regarded
the period as post-Homeric. Thus he says<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>: ‘According to
early custom which we find reflected in Homer, murder and
manslaughter were not regarded as crimes against the State,
but concerned exclusively the family of the slain man....
But gradually, as the worship of the souls of the dead and the
deities of the underworld developed, the belief gained ground
that he who shed blood was impure and needed cleansing....
This notion of manslaughter as a religious offence necessarily
led to the interference of the State.’ We admit, of course,
that there could not have been State trial before the State
came into being; but the notion that there were no ‘trials’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
before the days of ‘State trial’ is, we think, one of the delusions
which modern minds have derived from the legacy of feudalism.
Bury admits the existence of religious courts before the period
of State courts, but he apparently forgets the courts of the
clan, of the phratry, and of the tribe.</p>

<p>It is frequently suggested that the right of sanctuary is
the ultimate origin of the trials and negotiations which came to
be associated with homicide. ‘Among the Greeks,’ says Gilbert,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
‘when blood was shed, the relatives of the murdered man
usually set themselves to wreak vengeance on the murderer.
If he did not quit the country immediately, he could only
secure himself by taking refuge in a sanctuary until he had
made compensation to the relatives of his victim. From
his sanctuary, protected by the right of asylum, he could
enter into negotiations with them as to what compensation
must be paid. When the State took into its own hands the
regulation of vengeance for bloodshed, it respected the right
of sanctuary in so far that the three places<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of trial were
connected with three sanctuaries.’ Now we can find no
evidence for the operation of a right of sanctuary in Homer.
Hence this theory of Gilbert would compel us to believe that
not only murder trials but even wergeld payments were of
post-Homeric origin!</p>

<p>Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in a passage which we have already quoted, refuses
to see in the subjugation of blood-lust which is involved in
the acceptance of wergeld, any suggestion of the interference
of ‘social justice,’ whether to impose or advise a settlement,
or to fix the amount of compensation. He holds, moreover,
that in no case is exile authorised: that it is always a flight
from the natural penalty, which is death. ‘L’exil,’ he says,
‘dans ces conditions, n’est pour le meurtrier ni une peine ni
un droit, mais une mesure de prudence ... on ne peut
obtenir l’autorisation de s’en aller tranquillement ni de revenir
jamais.’<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is only, he implies,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> when the idea of pollution
abolished the arbitrary nature of State jurisdiction that the
offended party was forced by public opinion to accept the
customary wergeld. It is only then that a person wrongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
accused could appeal to judges who must hear the case.
Thus he says: ‘C’est un fait assez fréquent dans l’histoire
qu’à l’origine de la législation sociale il y ait une révolution
religieuse ... mais la révolution qui en résulta fut diffuse.
Elle ne fut personifiée que par un dieu. Vers les temps où
la Grèce commence à se purifier et à demander au ciel un
supplément de justice pour la terre, elle voit sur son horizon
rayonner d’une lumière inconnue le sévère et doux guérisseur
du mal et de la souillure, Apollon.... Il exige que tout
crime soit expié et s’en prend au peuple qui manque à ce
devoir.... L’expiation, il la fait consister, chaque fois qu’il
peut, à élever un sanctuaire: par là il donne aux dieux leur
part de la ποινή et aux juges la première idée de l’amende,
en même temps qu’il multiplie les lieux d’asile et fait servir
l’homicide même à sauver des vies humaines.... Tandis que
le droit religieux absorbait la plus grande partie de la θέμις
familiale pour la transmettre à la δίκη sociale, la juridiction
de l’Etat perdait son caractère d’arbitrage.... Sous la pression
de l’opinion publique ... l’offense fut tenu de plus en
plus strictement d’accepter une transaction aux conditions
modérées de la coutume ... l’offenseur qui trouvait exorbitantes
les exigences de l’offensée put rejeter une αἴδεσις trop
onéreuse: l’innocent qui ne croyait devoir aucun dédommagement
put refuser le paiement d’une ποινή injuste, sans craindre
la mort ou l’exil.... Le recours en justice, de facultatif
qu’il était, devint obligatoire par sa fréquence même. A ce
moment, le tribunal des gérontes, sentant son pouvoir plus
ferme, franchit par un empiètement fatal et naturel les limites
étroites où sa compétence était primitivement circonscrite....
La juridiction criminelle est créée.’</p>

<p>We shall see later<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> how impossible it was that wergeld
could have continued to exist in days when the murderer was
polluted. We admit that the Apolline murder-code did
absorb much of the clan-customs in regard to homicide (<i>la
θέμις familiale</i>). But from the account which we have given
of the wergeld system,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> it must be obvious how very
non-arbitrary was the jurisdiction of the clans. In our view,
the evolution of early Greek judicial authority is not a transition
from a crude arbitrary local jurisdiction to an efficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
central compulsory jurisdiction, but rather a gradual extension
to wider areas, in accordance with increasing political
synoekism, of the judicial functions which had been previously
discharged with equal authority within smaller areas.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
court of Elders, to which Homer refers in his description of
the Shield of Achilles, was, in our opinion, a city-state court.
We may call it merely a city court if we wish to retain the
word ‘State’ to denote a political unit exercising authority
over a substantial territorial area, and it is in this sense that
the word ‘State’ is generally used: but F. de Coulanges has
shown that the difference between the ancient ‘city’ and a
‘State’ was one of degree, not of kind. The ancient ‘phratry’
was, he says,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ‘a small society modelled on the family.’
Maine,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> speaking of the primitive Indian Village Community,
says: ‘The Community is more than a brotherhood of relatives
and more than an association of partners. It is an organised
society, and besides providing for the management of the common
fund, it seldom fails to provide, by a complete staff of
functionaries, for internal government, for police, for the
administration of justice, and for the apportionment of taxes
and public duties.’ So, we think, the court which Homer
describes had the highest jurisdiction in all matters of serious
dispute, whether within the city proper or in rural areas
which were politically united with the city. The elders
of the trial-scene were, we think, tribal chieftains, like the
Attic tribe-kings (φυλοβασιλεῖς), and their main function
was to arbitrate, but with full authority, in cases of dispute
between people of different clans or phratries. Inside the
clan, and probably inside the phratry (a group of neighbouring
clans), similar assemblies of interested and responsible persons
would have decided disputes between members of their associations.
The only judicial change which synoekism and the
growth of State-power involved was, therefore, an extension
of the area of jurisdiction, and an increase in the number of
people who had the right, if not the duty, of referring their
disputes to a common authority. But this new central court
of justice was neither incompatible with, nor destructive of,
the more primitive local courts. Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> maintains that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
Plutarch and Thucydides are wrong in the assertion that
Theseus abolished the local magistracies of Attica. Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
admits that the Attic tribe-kings still functioned as judges
in inter-tribal disputes, in historical Athens. It is quite
possible that, in early times, there was no right of appeal
outside the tribal court for members of the same tribe. There
is a law<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of an Anglo-Saxon king of tribal England which
decrees: ‘Let no man apply to the king unless he may not
be entitled to justice within his “hundred.”’</p>

<p>The judicial system of the Homeric epoch is complicated by
the presence of the quasi-feudal Achaeans, who sometimes hear
appeals in cases of ‘petty family disputes’ among the natives,
but who, amongst themselves, obeyed the short and swift
decrees of military courts or councils of war. We have said<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
that there is a suggestion of Achaean arbitration in the
Euripidean legend in which Hecuba appeals to Agamemnon to
justify, after the event, her punishment of Polymestor, the
slayer of her son.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Assuming the view of Leaf<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that the
Achaeans did not interfere with the ‘group-system’ of the
Pelasgians, we may for the moment ignore the presence of
the Achaeans, though it is the predominance of that caste
in Homer which has misled modern scholars in their opinions
of the early Greek judicial system. We shall now examine
some interesting survivals of clan-courts in the days of Plato
and Demosthenes, so that we may realise more clearly the
nature and the functions of the local courts of the ‘group
system,’ courts which Homer almost ignores, which he would,
perhaps, have entirely omitted to mention, if the Pelasgian
craftsmen who fashioned the ‘Shield of Achilles’ had not engraved
upon the Shield a picture of a Pelasgian Court of
Elders, which was a familiar event in the everyday life of the
cities and tribes of the subject-race.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Historical Survivals of Clan Courts</span></h4>

<p>The first instance of ‘survival’ which we shall cite is
mentioned by Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and in justice to him we must point out
that we differ from him, not in regard to the question of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
existence of clan-courts, but in regard to the nature of their
judicial functions in the matter of homicide. Glotz is not
aware of the distinction between the Pelasgians and the
Achaeans, or of the importance of the group system in the
Pelasgian civilisation. He admits that there existed within
the clan a regular tribunal, composed of heads of families,
who consulted and decreed, with absolute authority, on all
matters affecting property, such as adoption, inheritance,
expulsion, and marriage. He quotes Plato<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> for a procedure
which, he presumes, was a general characteristic of the clans.
We have seen that homicide, in default of wergeld, was
commonly punished by exile or banishment. The following
is Plato’s description of an expulsion from the clan: ‘For him
upon whom there has come a desire, by no means fortunate,
whether just or not, to release from relationship to himself
one whom he has begotten and brought up, let it not be lawful
to do this upon slight grounds or without delay; let him first
bring together his own relations as far as his cousins, and also
those of his son on the mother’s side, and let him accuse his
son before them and prove that he deserves completely to be
expelled from the family—and let him allow his son to prove
equally that he does not deserve to suffer anything of the
kind; and if the father can persuade and secure the votes of
more than half all the relations (father, mother, son, and
minors not voting),<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> then let it be lawful for the father to
renounce his son: but otherwise not.’ It is most important
to note here the reference to the presence of the son’s maternal
relatives, for this implies an assembly of the clan or wider
kindred, not merely of the gwely or descendants of a
common living ancestor. It was this wider kindred which paid
and accepted wergeld, even though they had not all a right
of succession to family property. In the early clan system,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
wergeld was part of the common stock which was inherited
by all the wider kindred, and therefore decrees of expulsion,
such as were pronounced, for instance, in default of wergeld
payment, were matters for the decision of the whole clan rather
than for those of the gwely or the ‘family.’ That such a
procedure should have survived in Plato’s time, when property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
had to a great extent become ‘private’ in the modern sense,
and when the political power of the clans had long since
vanished into thin air, shows at once the tenacity of clan
custom and the significance of Plato’s account as an argument
from survivals.</p>

<p>Plato has another reference to a clan court, to which Glotz
has not referred and which seems to us to furnish a splendid
illustration of the manner in which minor issues, which affected
merely the members of a local kindred, remained within the
scope of clan jurisdiction even in historical Athens. We shall
see later<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that, owing to religious influences, kin-slaying
became too serious a matter for the adjudication of clan
tribunals from the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards. Even minor
cases of bloodshed such as ‘wounding with intent’ had
probably, in historical times, been transferred to the jurisdiction
of an Attic state court, called the Areopagus.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The
clan court to which Plato refers, in the present instance, seems
to have had power to try and to punish the wounding of a
kinsman by a kinsman, in a passion; it is presumed, however,
that the wound was not sufficiently grave to interfere with
military service. Plato says<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>: ‘If one kinsman<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> wounds
another ... let the heads of families<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (<i>i.e.</i> the elders) and
the male and female kindred, as far as the cousins<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> on the
male and female side, come together and having tried the
case deliver the offender to his natural parents to fix the fine<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>:
and if the fixing of the fine be a matter of doubt, let the
kindred on the male side fix the fine definitely; and if they
are unable to decide, let them eventually refer the matter
to the “guardians of the laws.”’ Plato goes on to say that
where children wound their parents (presumably in a passion)
the judges must be over sixty years of age, none of them must
be a relative of the offender, and they may fix the punishment,
which may include death.</p>

<p>We have already hinted<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that the discrimination between
degrees of guilt in homicide cases, which is extremely minute
in the laws of Plato, and which is present in a cruder form in
the Draconian code, finds its ultimate origin in the old customs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of tribal life. Bearing this hypothesis in mind, we are not
surprised to discover that such matters as wounding <i>without
intent</i>, which is not mentioned in Dracon’s code and which
therefore was not a matter for compulsory prosecution in Attic
state courts, can nevertheless be subjects for adjudication in
the courts of the clans. Of course, the ‘guardians of the
laws’ whom Plato mentions are technically officers of Plato’s
ideal State, but the main factors in the trial are doubtless
derived from actual clan tribunals which operated in Plato’s
own experience, unless the ‘guardians of the laws’ are to
be interpreted as symbolical of the appellant jurisdiction of
the State. Glotz, of course, thinks<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that at no time was kin-bloodshed
a matter for Greek State courts, but we shall see,
later, that this view is most probably incorrect. Plato insists
that the judges who condemn to death the child who is guilty
of wounding its parent must not be akin to the child. This
principle need not imply that the judges must have been
State judges. In the phratry and in the tribe one could find
many men over sixty years of age who were not akin to such
an offender. The fact that these judges in historical times
had the power of condemning an offender to death is probably
to be attributed to a survival of tribal jurisdiction in cases
where that jurisdiction had not been definitely arrogated by
the State.</p>

<p>A further instance of the survival of clan and phratry
courts may be found in the law of Dracon<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which prescribed
a collective decree of ‘appeasement’ in cases of involuntary
homicide. The law may be freely translated thus: ‘Let there
be “appeasement” if there is a father or brother or sons (of
the victim): let all agree or let one objector hold the field;
if there be none such, let all the kinsmen within the degree of
cousin (be appeased) if all consent to be appeased; if there
are none of these, and the slayer slew involuntarily, let ten
phratores be appeased if all consent to be appeased.’ The
procedure here prescribed applied only to involuntary homicide.
Before the ‘appeasement’ a period of exile had to be completed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
by the slayer.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is not a case of <i>accidental homicide</i>,
which involved no punishment.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Glotz<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> argues that the
phrase ἅπαντας ἢ τὸν κωλύοντα κρατεῖν implies a universal
clan consent; but it is obvious that the law is satisfied by
the consent of groups within the clan or (in default of these)
of the consent of ten phratores, who were members of the same
local religious union. The only point we wish to make here
is that in this survival of the consent of the kindred for the
abolition of a feud caused by involuntary homicide we have
all the elements which would have constituted a homicide
tribunal in days before the encroachment of State power. It
can only be a survival of a wergeld system of vengeance,
as in this system alone is there found a minute arrangement
for payment and receipt according to the different degrees
of kinship. A similar law of clan-consent governed the rights
and duties of <i>burial</i>, even in the time of Demosthenes, and is
appealed to as evidence for the right of succession to property.
Demosthenes thus quotes<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> a law of Solon: ‘it shall not be
lawful for any woman under sixty years of age to enter into
the chamber of deceased or to follow the corpse when it is
carried to the tomb except those within the degree of cousins’
children.’ A law of Dracon<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> decreed that after burial of a
murdered man ‘proclamation shall be made to the homicide
in the market place by all the relatives within the degree of
cousin; and cousins and children of cousins and sons-in-law
and fathers-in-law and phratores shall prosecute.’ Here we
have a clear picture of the solidarity of the clan. The presence
of the φράτορες, too, is significant. They were strictly outside
the clan, as each phratry included members of neighbouring
clans who were bound together by a common extra-clan
worship. In this co-operation of the φράτορες we plainly see
a natural basis for discussion and negotiation in blood feuds
between different clans; this co-operation extended also, in
certain cases, to the tribe and, after a coalition of tribes, to
the ‘ancient city.’<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Thus Glotz<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> rightly says: ‘La famille
fictive suit les principes de la famille naturelle.... On dirait
que le groupe a conservé, en souvenir d’une parenté primitive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
en vertu d’une parenté théorique, un droit éminent sur les
biens de chacun.’</p>

<p>So Fustel de Coulanges points out that just as each <i>gens</i><a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
or clan had its own tribunal and chief, so also the phratry<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
had its own phratriarch, assemblies and tribunals. ‘It was,’ he
says, ‘a small society modelled on the family,’ and the tribe<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
had, as chief priest and judge, a tribe-king (φυλοβασιλεύς),
and held assemblies whose decrees bound all tribesmen. The
nature of such tribal conventions and decrees is further
illustrated by a passage in Demosthenes, to which Coulanges
refers.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In a speech against Theocrines,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Demosthenes
narrates how the fellow-tribesmen of Theocrines convicted
him of the embezzlement of tribal funds and punished him
by a fine; and he was forbidden by State law to prefer any
indictments against any citizen until he had paid this fine,
as in the meantime he was regarded as a State debtor. The
decree was moved against him at a tribal meeting by a certain
Scironides and the fine proposed was seven minae.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> From
such passages as this Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> argues that Plutarch and
Thucydides are mistaken when they say that Theseus destroyed
the local magistracies after the synoekism of Attica. This
Demosthenic passage indicates clearly the survival of courts
whose primeval jurisdiction had been largely superseded by
that of the State.</p>

<p>Apart from those arguments which are based on the survivals
of tribalism, it is logically probable that since homicide
in Pelasgian society was normally atoned for by the payment
of a collective wergeld penalty, which affected the property
of at least two clans, and since the judicial machinery of
Pelasgian tribes was such that it would ordinarily have been
set in motion for adjudication in disputes regarding property,
homicide was therefore a fit and proper subject for investigation
by such tribunals.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Shield of Achilles and the Royal Judges</span></h4>

<p>Homer, in describing the Shield of Achilles, happens to
mention a court which is appealed to in a dispute concerning
wergeld, and such a reference is as complete a confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of our hypothesis as can reasonably be expected.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> We have
already given what we consider to be the correct interpretation
of this passage. The Elders were Pelasgian tribal chieftains,
who frequently came together and sat upon polished stones,
‘in a sacred circle,’ holding in their hands the sceptre of
authority. It is quite probable, as Leaf<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> suggests, that two
of the Elders acted as ‘advocates,’ and it is almost certain<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
that the two talents of gold which are mentioned were a kind
of advocate’s fee which was deposited by both litigants in
order to encourage the advocates to give a proper exposition
of the unwritten code of the tribes. The fact that the dispute
concerned the payment of wergeld, and not the reality of
guilt, does not warrant the conclusion that the court of Elders
could not have functioned, if it were necessary, as a murder
court. It is true that in the group system of primitive tribal
life there was never very much difficulty in establishing the
identity of the murderer; but it is equally true that if an accusation
was challenged or disputed, there must have existed a
court whose decision would have been accepted as final: we
cannot conceive an entire clan agreeing to pay the wergeld
of 120 cows if the person who was accused of homicide had
assured his own clan court that he was innocent. Now the
Elders of the Homeric trial-scene would normally have
adjudicated in cases of homicide between the members of
different tribes; and it is possible that they would have heard
appeals from tribal or phratry courts, in the event of disagreement
about inter-tribal cases. The Elders are therefore
the <i>real</i> δικασπόλοι βασιλεῖς of the Homeric society. The fact
that the Achaean kings are credited with this <i>title</i> in Homer does
not prove that they ever functioned as such. Leaf<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> thinks
that they might have consented to hear appeals in isolated
instances, but the title δικασπόλος is one which could frequently
have been applied without very much significance to Achaean
feudal lords who possessed a theoretical supremacy in Greek
jurisdiction. Within the Achaean caste, these lords revealed
no interest nor did they acknowledge any obligations in the
judicial aspect of homicide. On the contrary, they frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
gave their daughters in marriage to murderers! We think,
therefore, that Leaf would not now find so much difficulty in
the absence of a ‘king’ in the Homeric trial-scene as he did
in 1883.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It is not certain, of course, in what Greek areas
Pelasgian groups still retained Pelasgian kings. The Minoan
kings of Mycenae, Lacedaemon, and Thessaly, and other
districts disappeared in the Achaean conquest. Still there
survived a few Minoan or Pelasgian kings who lived in friendly
alliance with the Achaeans, and who could still be truly described
as defending ‘the Zeus-given θέμιστες.’ But it is
also true that at the time of the Trojan war the Achaean
lords would have come to be regarded as the ‘heaven-sent
guardians of law,’ through the mere fact that they were
‘kings.’</p>

<p>Maine<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> thinks that the θέμιστες (customs) of the Homeric
age were isolated judgments delivered without any orderly
sequence or precedent. But Glotz<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> insists that the word
θέμις is peculiarly applicable to tribal custom, as opposed to
the terms δίκη and νόμος. We believe that the word generally
refers to Pelasgian traditions.</p>

<p>In the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> we are told that Zeus is wrathful against
men who judge crookedly in the Assembly, and drive out
Justice. Who are these men? They may, of course, be
Achaeans, but we think it more probable that they are the
judges, and therefore the chiefs, of Pelasgian tribes—judges
whose tribal successors were accused of corruption in the days
of Hesiod,<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> when the Achaeans were no more. In Homer two
talents of gold were offered as a reward for an advocate’s
successful pleading, and the advocates were probably chosen
from the same caste as the judges. From this it is but a short
step to bribery and the corruption of justice. Hence we can
understand the words of Hesiod: ‘The people pay for the
folly of their kings, who with ill thoughts wrest aside judgments,
declaring falsely. Beware of these things, ye kings, and set
straight your speech, bribe-devourers, and utterly forget
crooked judgments.’ And again<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>: ‘There is the noise of the
haling of Justice wheresoever bribe-devouring men hale her,
adjudging dooms with crooked judgments. And she followeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
weeping, clad in mist and fraught with doom, unto the city
and the homes of men who drive her forth.’ In ancient society
social law is inseparable from religion; as Coulanges puts it<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>:
‘To disobey law is sacrilege.’ The law was regarded as the
exclusive secret of the hereditary nobility,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> who alone could
interpret it and whose decision was final. The opportunities
for profit-making and bribery in such a system must have been
innumerable. In later times when democracy asserts itself
the less-privileged orders,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> championed sometimes by tribal
or quasi-feudal kings, sometimes by usurping tyrants, equipped
with mercenaries, compelled the ‘Elders’—that is, the old
patriarchal sacerdotal nobility—to codify their laws and to
admit to judicial power the ‘new nobility’ of wealth and the
ignoble proletariat. The old nobility came then to be distinguished
for the integrity of its judicial character, partly
because it had lost its monopoly of power, partly because
corruption could no longer be practised with impunity.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Origin of Homicide Courts</span></h4>

<p>From what has been already said<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> it must be sufficiently
clear what was, in our opinion, the origin of murder-trial in
early Greece. The local courts of clans and tribes constituted
a nucleus for the development of central State courts when
civic groups emerged into being through political synoekism.
Homicide was a proper subject for litigation, in the tribal
wergeld system, simply because the normal penalty involved
a transfer of collective property or the expulsion of a tribesman.
If then phratry-courts had to decide issues between
different neighbouring clans, if tribal courts had to decide
disputes between clans of widely separated localities, is it not
natural to suppose that the State courts of synoekised areas
would have adjudicated in disputes between members of
different tribes? Hence the judicial assembly of tribe-kings
(φυλοβασιλεῖς) constituted a more or less important State
court from the most remote antiquity. In historical Athens,
Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> assures us that they still judged, at the Prytaneum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
indictments concerning animals and inanimate objects (δικαὶ
ἀψύχων). Glotz<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> says of the Prytaneum Court: ‘Il semble
même qu’il ait été le premier et longtemps le seul tribunal
d’Athènes.’</p>

<p>Let us now consider some other hypotheses as to the origin
and evolution of homicide-courts. Glotz and Bury are in
agreement in supposing that wergeld was abolished, not by
the Apolline religion, but by the establishment of State power:
though, in so far as it was the Apolline doctrine of ‘pollution’
which compelled the State to interfere, they would be compelled
to admit that Apollinism contributed to the abolition of
wergeld if it did not directly abolish it. Glotz, in particular,
is anxious to establish a novel theory of his own,<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> to the effect
that it was Solon, not Dracon, who abolished wergeld!
The only reason he gives is that Solon’s general policy was
opposed to clan-jurisdiction or clan-power exercised to the
detriment of the State. This opinion we shall discuss in its
proper place.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But there is an important element of truth
in the Glotz-Bury position which must be clearly indicated.
We have said that the original Pelasgian State courts very
probably heard disputes in regard to homicide, at least between
members of different tribes. Now, tribal society is based on a
close exclusive aristocracy of birth. Strangers may be received
with temporary hospitality, but their adoption into the permanent
life and privileges of the tribe was a matter of great
difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Every tribe contained a gradually increasing
number of ‘hangers-on,’ lackland men, bondsmen, serfs, and
casual vagrants, who may be regarded as the nucleus of the
plebeian movement which in many cases culminated in
democracy. The growth of commerce in the seventh century,
the invention of coinage, migration and colonisation led to
the rise of a new aristocracy of wealth<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> as distinct from birth.
Many of the ‘new men,’ who now were very powerful, did
not belong to the old aristocratic tribes. In cases of homicide
between members of this new group, who would act as judge?
The tribe-kings regarded such a group as entirely outside
their caste. For such a group there was neither religion nor
law nor justice. Hence they probably resorted to what we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
have described as unrestricted vendetta. It was precisely
at this juncture, as we think, that the new religion of Apollo,
with its quasi-Asiatic doctrine of murder as a ‘pollution,’
came to Greece. Murder now became a ‘sin’ against the
State gods. If unpunished, it brought upon the State the
anger of its gods. State courts were now compelled to sit in
judgment on all cases of homicide which occurred within the
State: no longer were the tribes permitted to adjudicate for
intra-tribal slaying. They could still hold ‘minor investigations’
at their local Prytaneum; though we cannot agree
with Müller and Philippi in describing as a ‘mock-trial’<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
their investigations into the guilt of animals and inanimate
objects (δικαὶ ἀψύχων). But the man ‘who shed man’s blood’
had now to appear before the central tribunals of the State:
all men had to appear, not merely the aristocratic heirs of
tribal privilege. This, in our view, is what happened in the
seventh and sixth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In the circumstances of the
time it was an event of incalculable utility to Greek societies.
But the lustre of the event and the chaos which it terminated
have dazzled the minds of modern thinkers so much that they
forget the older and, for the period of its power, the equally
effective vigour of the courts of the tribal State. <i>Thus, what
Glotz and Bury have attributed to the evolution of State power is
really to be attributed to the new non-tribal democracy and the
religion of Apollo.</i></p>

<p>The view of Gilbert and Köhler,<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and, we may add, of
Müller,<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which places the origin of trials for homicide in the
conception of bloodshed as a sin and in the respect for
sanctuary, remains for discussion. Müller is, we think,
mistaken in supposing that bloodshed was sinful from the
earliest dawn of Greek society, and that wergeld originated
in the purgation-ritual.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This opinion we shall criticise at
length in the next chapter. Gilbert’s conception that the
right of sanctuary existed from immemorial antiquity and was
a necessary preliminary to wergeld negotiations cannot be
harmonised with the evidence of the Homeric poems or with
the customs of other analogous tribal peoples. We shall find,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
indeed, in Euripidean legends evidence of the efficacy of
sanctuary to protect<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the suppliant, but we also find evidence
that it was potent merely to delay<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the inevitable doom. In
Homer there is no suggestion that an Achaean would have ever
heeded, or that a Pelasgian would have ever needed, such a
refuge. Quick vengeance, permitting, as Demosthenes says,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
no κρίσις between φόνος and τιμωρία, is not a characteristic
of the tribal wergeld system. In regard to later times,
Gilbert says that ‘when the State took into its own hands the
regulation of vengeance for bloodshed it respected the right of
sanctuary in so far that the three places of trial were connected
with three sanctuaries.’ He refers, we presume, to the Attic
courts known as the Areopagus, the Palladium, and the
Delphinium. But the connexion of these courts with local
temples may be otherwise explained. Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> points out
that the assembly-place of the Roman Senate, which was a
judicial as well as an administrative council, was always a
temple. We shall see later that the murderer in the ‘pollution’
period was debarred from any contact with a temple
under most serious penalties. We must then defer to a subsequent
stage of our work<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the final refutation of Gilbert and
of Müller and the complete exposition of our own hypothesis
as to the origin and evolution of the Attic murder courts.</p>

<span class="smaller">RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF HOMICIDE IN EARLY GREECE</span></h3>

<p>Current views: digression on evolution of Greek religion: ancestor-worship:
nature-worship: animal sacra: image-magic: anthropomorphism:
Achaean and Pelasgian contributions to Homeric religion: fusion of
Achaean and Pelasgian dogma and ritual: religious aspect of kin-slaying
amongst Pelasgians and Achaeans: origin and evolution of the Erinnyes:
origin of homicide-purgation: comparison of Pelasgian with Achaean
Erinnys, and of Homeric Erinnys with post-Homeric and ‘tragic’
Erinnys.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a considerable variety and conflict of opinions about
the religious aspect of homicide in Homeric Greece. We have
already explained by quotations from Glotz<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Bury<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the theory which conceives the shedding of human blood as
a deed which, in those days, did not touch the gods or draw
down the anger of the gods on the community. On the
other hand, Leaf, who indicates a clear and emphatic distinction
between the religious beliefs and customs of the
Achaeans and the Pelasgians, holds that the Achaeans ignored
and the Pelasgians respected<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> ‘the most sacred of all taboos
which forbids the shedding of <i>kindred blood</i>’: for the
Pelasgians retained the ‘primitive family system, with all
its rites and taboos’<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and possessed, therefore, the foundations
of primitive society and religion.’<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Again, Fustel de
Coulanges, in his analysis of the primeval domestic religion
of the Ancient City, says<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that ‘the shedder of blood was no
longer able to sacrifice: the hand stained with blood could
not touch sacred objects.’ He believes, however, that<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the
manslayer could be purified by an expiatory ceremony.
Miss Harrison holds a somewhat similar view<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>: ‘Purification,’
she says, ‘is the placation of ghosts and, unknown to the
Olympians (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Achaeans</i>), was the keynote of the lower stratum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
(<i>i.e.</i> <i>Pelasgians</i>).’ ... ‘The extreme need of primitive man
for placation is from bloodshed: this is at first obtained by
offering the blood of the murderer; later, by the blood of a
surrogate victim applied to him.’ ... ‘So long as primitive
man preserves the custom of the blood feud, so long will he
credit his dead kinsman with passions like his own.’<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> So,
Müller maintains<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that the religious rites of expiation and
purification are derived from the remotest times of Greek
antiquity and were designed to reinstate the slayer in religious
communion with his family and his comrades. Purgation
ceremonies are, he thinks,<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> based upon the idea that the manslayer
must atone with his own life, but that this life may be
bought off by vicarial substitution, by a sacrificial victim
symbolical of such substitution. Our own views upon these
subjects will appear in the course of the discussion: we shall
point out, amongst other things, the distinction between
expiation (ἱλασμός) and purgation (καθαρμός), and while
refusing to accept on the one hand the views of Müller and of
Miss Harrison, and indicating, on the other hand, the inaccuracies
in the views of Glotz, Bury and the generality of
writers, we shall develop and expand a theory which is
suggested by Leaf’s<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> general position and which distinguishes
carefully between the religious attitude of the Pelasgians and
the Achaeans. To achieve this purpose it will, however, be
necessary, even at the cost of a digression, to give a brief
account of the evolution of early Greek religion.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Analysis of Early Greek Religion</span></h4>

<p>To the scientific mind of a modern European living in the
atmosphere of a highly secularised society, nothing can appear
more curious and incomprehensible than the almost universal
belief in ubiquitous supernatural forces which is revealed in
ancient literature. Such a belief is not, however, a symbol
of savagery or barbarism; it is merely a symptom of the
absence of scientific knowledge. The general principle that
men in all ages attribute to occult forces every effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
which the cause is unknown or mysterious, is clearly expressed
by Lucretius<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">quippe ita formido mortales continet omnes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quod multa in terris fieri caeloque tuentur</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">possunt ac fieri divino numine rentur.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was natural then, in an age of unscientific mentality, that
plagues and pestilences, and diseases of all kinds, lunacy and
sterility, the failure of harvests, misfortune in peace or war,
adverse winds, volcanoes, inherited characteristics, the
activities of genius, emotion and desire, birth, growth, death
and decay—almost everything that crosses the threshold of
human consciousness—should be ascribed to the ubiquitous
and perpetual operation of supernatural agents. The literature
of ancient Greece and Rome is permeated with such beliefs.
We will quote just one characteristic passage from the
<i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus. When the avenging Erinnyes of
the slain Clytaemnestra threaten to hurl the shafts of their
wrath upon the Attic land because it has harboured Orestes,
whom they regard as the murderer of his kin, Athene, who
has caused a murder-court to declare him free from guilt,
apparently on a plea of justifiable homicide, commands the
Erinnyes to be appeased, and says: ‘Hurl you not the
weight of your wrath upon Attica; be not indignant, nor cause
barrenness by sending down the blighting drops that come
from Spirits, the cruel bitter destroyers of our seed.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ...
Fling not upon earth the fruit of thy wild curse, causing all
things not to prosper.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> ... Sow not within my boundaries
those spurs to bloodshed that ruin young men’s hearts,
maddened by a frenzy not born of wine<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> ... but (send)
blessings from earth and from the waters of the deep, and from
the sky wind-breezes that blow with kindly sunshine over
earth: (send) fruit of the soil and of things that live, flowing
with untiring vigour to my citizens, and of man’s seed a safe
deliverance at the birth.’<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Erinnyes, in consenting to
be appeased, reply: ‘With kindly prophecy we pray for
you here, that the radiant sunlight may bring forth with speed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
from earth the blessings of your life<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> ... never—such is
my boon—may the trees feel the hurtful wind or the scorching
fire that robs them of their buds ... or blight creep over
them eternally that blasts their fruitfulness: and may Pan
bring to full growth the prosperous flocks that will bear from
wombs a twofold fruit, and in due season may the produce of
rich earth present you with the good gods’ gift of fortune<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>:
... on the young men I forbid to fall the stroke of death
untimely: and that the lovely maids find each her husband—do
ye grant it, O ye who reign, and ye, O Fates divine!<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>...
May the roar of Faction, thirsting for evil, never in this place
be heard, nor the dust that drinks the dark blood of fellow-citizens
bring to the State, from passion for revenge, the
doom of retaliation. But may the citizens rejoice one
another with a common love and hate only in union as
one man.’<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The modern European, taught in childhood to accept the
Christian doctrine of the divine creation of the world, must
exert himself considerably if he is to realise that in Greek
religion the notion of such a creation is not found before the
fifth and fourth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and even then it existed only
in the atmosphere of a pious philosophic sect. To the ancient
Greek mind, the earth was not created; it had been from
everlasting: it was itself divine. Gilbert Murray rightly
says<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that the chief objects of primitive man’s emotional
activity are the food-supply and the tribe-supply. By a
well-known confusion of cause and effect characteristic of the
primitive mind, the earth became the object of universal
worship, because of its association with the production of
food.</p>

<p>Similarly, animals came to be regarded as sacred, though
different races adopted different viewpoints in regard to their
sacred character. In some instances a certain animal was
‘sacred’ simply because it was eaten: in others it was
‘sacred’ because it was ‘tabu’ or sinful to eat it. We shall
see that the animal slain in certain Chthonian rites could not
be eaten,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> but it was ‘sacred’ all the same. The ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
notion, which has survived so long in witchcraft, of the magical
power of placation by images or effigies led to the widespread
construction of those animal images which are so
familiar to the students of primitive religion.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> When
divinities in human form, when anthropomorphic <i>sacra</i>, take
precedence of the animal god, traces of a fusion in image-magic
are clearly visible. Whether by accident, or by reason
of some traditional connexion, certain human gods came to
be associated with certain species of animals. The sacrifice
of such animals was regarded as particularly pleasing to such
gods, and it is therefore arbitrary to assume that the sacrifice
of animals was originally accepted as a substitute for a previous
human sacrifice. Herodotus says<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that the image of Isis in
Egypt was that of a woman with cow’s horns: that a statue
of Zeus in Egypt showed the figure of a man with the face of
a ram. When the people of Egyptian Thebes sacrificed,
annually, a ram to Zeus, they covered the statue of Zeus with
the skin of the ram.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> We know that the worshippers of the
orgiastic Dionysus clothed themselves in fawn-skins,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and
that the satyric choruses from which, we may suppose, Greek
tragedy developed,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> were dressed, to some extent, as goats.
The goat and the snake, as well as the bull and the ram, seem
to have been worshipped in early times as symbols at once
of the fertility of the soil and of the fertility of the race. The
serpents which gaze at us so terribly from the heads of the
Aeschylean Erinnys are probably, in origin,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> derived from
the belief that the souls of the dead are connected with the
fertility of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Herodotus tells us that offerings were
regularly made to an imaginary serpent which was supposed
to reside in the temple of Athene Polias at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This
serpent symbolised, like the undying fire of the Roman Vesta,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
the immortal progenitor of the race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Anthropomorphism and the Olympians</span></h4>

<p>In regard to the origin of anthropomorphic religion in
Greece, we can only say that we prefer the opinion of F. de
Coulanges,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which derives it from the ancestor worship of
the early Pelasgian peoples, to that of Miss Harrison which, in
its latest form, attributes it to a political anti-Persian reaction
of the sixth and fifth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Coulanges believes
that when once the idea of human gods took shape, it tended
at once to personify and humanise all the various objects of
worship.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It is significant that the Persians, who had no
ancestor worship, did not conceive their gods in human form.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Amongst the Greeks, however, who worshipped dead ancestors
from the dawn of their history, the ‘ghost’ gave its form to
the god.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, Coulanges’ theory of the evolution of
anthropomorphism, we must regard as absurd the opinion
of some ancient writers who maintained that Homer and
Hesiod not only told false stories about the gods but gave
them, moreover, the manners and shapes of men.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The
precise contribution of such poets as Homer to ancient religion
is difficult to define, but we believe that it was not so much
constructive as destructive. The poet gave a certain immortality
to the conceptions which he expressed: the effect
of a Bible in religious evolution is essentially conservative.
It tends to stereotype for all men and for all time the religious
opinions of its day. Now Homer was the poet of the Achaeans,
and the Achaeans, as Leaf says,<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> conceived the gods as typical
Achaeans of the other world. Whether they brought new
human gods<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> to Greece or merely gave a personal interpretation
to the Pelasgian gods, we need not at the moment decide.
The gods of the Achaeans were conceived as kings and rulers
like themselves. If they do not create the universe, they at
least divide it into realms or dominions.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Moreover, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
are presented as related to one another by blood, or connected
by intermarriage, as the Achaeans were. They naturally have
their quarrels, their disputes, their rivalries and their jealousies,
as the Achaeans had. The stamp of the Achaean caste marks
the Homeric pantheon. But apart from the great Olympian
gods, there are a number of minor deities who suggest the
existence of a less privileged social and religious caste. It
is in this caste that we believe that we can find the source of
supply or the materials for the creation of the Olympic
Pantheon. Such a Pantheon could never have been the
exclusive creation of Homer. If the Achaeans created it, they
were limited, surely, by the nature of the materials at their
disposal. Their creative power was restricted and directed,
as we believe, by a pre-Achaean evolution of grades of divine
greatness within the galaxy of Pelasgian divinities<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>: an
evolution which attributed to elemental forces and to national
ancestor-gods a power to which no mere local ‘ghost’ could
aspire to attain. The Pelasgians and Minoans in their tribal
villages, and particularly in their city-religion, had, we think,
evolved the distinction between the greater and the lesser
gods, between the gods of the upper air, and those of the sea
and of the earth below, which was so characteristic a feature
of later Greek religion. True, many of their ‘deities’ were
nameless, as Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> seems to have heard that they were
at Dodona, and as the ancestral spirits of historical times still
were, since they were addressed as <i>Keres</i> at the Athenian
Anthesteria.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But the old tribal and city gods must have
had names. It would have been otherwise impossible to
distinguish them from one another in the multitudinous
deifications of an ancestor-worshipping and nature-worshipping
peninsula. Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> holds that the local gods of primitive
peoples often carry the same name even when they are really
different in form and ritual. But here we think that we can
detect the influence of Homer and the Achaeans. The Homeric
god is stereotyped in form and character as in name. The
form and character was created, we believe, by the military
Achaean caste, while the name was in most if not all cases
a Pelasgian product. It was all the more possible for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Achaeans to give character and personality to the gods, if
there had been local variations in the Pelasgian types. Moreover,
the Achaeans drew, so to speak, a line of demarcation
around the gods of their choice. They created a Pantheon
of an exclusive type, which, by its prestige in later years,
checked the Pelasgian tendency to increase the number of
the greater gods, and compelled the Greeks to accept, instead,
the worship of <i>Heroes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The creation of such a Pantheon
presupposes, we think, the existence of an identity of type
within some widespread organised society. No mere local
poet or city-state could have created it. As we have no
evidence of the existence in pre-Homeric days of a national
union or federation of Minoan kings, or of a national
Amphictyony, such as we meet with in later times, we naturally
attribute to the ubiquitous Achaean caste and their poet-Royal
the creation of that Pantheon which was the mainstay
of Achaean religion. But this Pantheon was created out of
pre-existing Pelasgian materials. We do not agree with Leaf
and Chadwick in the view that the Achaeans were the <i>creators</i>
of Greek anthropomorphic religion.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Achaean-Pelasgian Religious Fusions</span></h4>

<p>Many of the difficulties presented by Homeric religion are
to be attributed to the fact that that religion was an eclectic
product. If we compare the beliefs and customs of the
Achaeans and the Pelasgians, it will be obvious that despite
the circumstance of their social coexistence, a complete blending
or fusion in dogma or in ritual would have been impossible.
Yet it is equally impossible to suppose that both Pelasgians
and Achaeans preserved their religious rites and conceptions
unadulterated and pure.</p>

<p>Miss Harrison is, we think, mistaken—she seems to admit
it in a later work<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>—in assuming that the Achaeans are to be
associated with Olympian ritual, and the Pelasgians with
Chthonian ritual, and that there is a rigid line of distinction
between the two castes. Just as the Olympian rites which
are so common amongst Homeric Achaeans were, we think,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
practised also by Minoan kings and Pelasgian nobles, so the
Chthonian rites of the tillers of soil were practised, on occasions,
by the Achaeans, and would perhaps have been more frequently
practised if there had not existed within the two castes
differences of dogma, such as we shall presently indicate. In
our analysis of the social and judicial aspect of Homeric homicide
we were enabled to differentiate clearly between the
Achaeans and Pelasgians, for their social organisations were
different and distinct. In a religious analysis, however, the
gulf cannot with equal clearness be indicated, if we suspect
that the practice of common rites and the eclectic conception
of common gods may have modified the differences which are
otherwise maintained. Leaf is aware of the complexity of
the problem, which he aptly describes as a ‘tangled skein.’<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
We do not, however, agree with Leaf’s opinion<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that ‘there
is no trace in Homer of any Chthonian religion,’ if the word
‘Chthonian’ carries its usual significance. Leaf implies that
the Achaeans, before they came to Greece, were worshippers
of the dead. The absence of such worship in Homer is, he
says,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> due to the severance of the military adventurer from the
tombs of his fathers. ‘It is impossible to pay due rites to the
departed when their tombs have been left far behind in the
course of long migrations.’ We have seen<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that the Achaeans
were long enough settled in Greece, at the time of the Trojan
war, to have produced relations extending to second and third
cousins once removed. Surely the habit of ancestor-worship
could easily have been renewed in the course of so many generations.
We believe that the Achaean conception of a spirit
land and their practice of cremation are a clear indication
of the absence of the primitive ideas of ghost-raising, ghost-laying
and fertility worship, which are the regular<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> concomitants
of the cult of the dead. <i>The dogmas which underlie these
different burial rites cannot, we think, be fused. They can only
combine by the evolution of an eclectic doctrine.</i> Had such a
doctrine evolved in Homer? The only passage in the Homeric
poems which can help us to decide is the <i>Nekuia</i><a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Nekuia of the <i>Odyssey</i>.</span></h4>

<p>Ridgeway’s theory<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of the difference between the Pelasgian
and the Achaean cults of the dead is now well known. The
former, he maintains, buried their dead, honoured them with
periodical offerings of food and drink, and believed that the dead
lived in a subconscious state in the tomb; the latter, however,
cremated their dead, practised no regular tomb offerings (χοαί),
and believed that the souls of the dead flitted away through
the air to a place called Hades in the west. The curious thing
about the <i>Nekuia</i> is that the souls of the dead in Hades are
represented as anxious for food and drink, and when Odysseus
sacrifices there, the ghosts come forth to lick up the blood of
the victim. Further, it is only when they have drunk the blood
that they regain their memory and recognise their friends again.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Odysseus thus describes the scene at the entrance to Hades to
which he has been miraculously permitted to descend: ‘There
(<i>i.e.</i> at the entrance to Hades) Perimedes and Eurylochus held
the victims and I drew my sharp sword ... and dug a pit ...
and about it poured a drink-offering to all the dead ... mead
and sweet wine and water ... and I took the sheep and cut
their throats over the trench and the dark blood flowed forth
and lo! the spirits of the dead came out of Erebus ... and
they flocked together from every side about the trench.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
First came Elpenor that had not yet been buried ...<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> (who
said) “Leave me not unwept and unburied ... burn me and
pile me a barrow on the shore....”<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Anon came the soul
of the Theban Teiresias ...<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (who said) “Whomsoever of
the dead thou shalt suffer to approach the blood, he shall
prophesy truthfully ...”<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>: my mother too drew nigh and
drank the dark blood and at once she knew me.’<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Miss Harrison seeks to explain the difficulty which is presented
by this unique passage concerning the Homeric cult of
the dead by maintaining that it is a fusion of <i>Chthonian and
Olympian ritual</i>.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> On the assumption which underlies the
reasoning in ‘Themis,’ namely, that the Homeric poems
assumed their final form and their characteristic theological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
setting in the time of Pisistratus,<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> it is surprising that we have
not more frequent instances of such a fusion in the Homeric
poems! Those poems contain many references to Chthonian
deities, <i>e.g.</i> to the Erinnyes, to Ge, and to Hades. But in the
<i>Nekuia</i> there is question not of gods but of ghosts—ghosts,
too, conceived in a predominantly Achaean way, as living
together in a western spirit-land. Other Chthonian rites are
frequently mentioned in Homer, but not the placation of ghosts.
Thus, in the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Agamemnon swears a solemn oath in
a manner which is essentially Chthonian. With sword in
hand and a boar prepared for sacrifice, he prays (or curses)
thus: ‘Be Zeus before all witness ... and Earth and Sun
and the Erinnyes who under Earth take vengeance upon men
who forswear themselves, that I ... and if aught that I
swear be false, may the gods give me all sorrows manifold....’
‘He spake and cut the boar’s throat with the pitiless knife:
and the body Talthybius whirled and threw into the great
wash of the hoary sea.’<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The reason for the action of
Talthybius in this passage is that, in Chthonian ritual the
animal which was slain to symbolise the hypothetical destruction
of the swearer if certain promises were not carried out,
could not be eaten and hence was thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Ridgeway, who believes that the whole of the <i>Iliad</i> and the
<i>Odyssey</i> was composed before 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and who has done so
much to differentiate Achaean and Pelasgian burial customs,
finds in the <i>Nekuia</i> a fusion of <i>Achaean and Pelasgian ideas</i>.
‘Such a blending of religious ideas,’ he says, ‘is but the natural
concomitant of the intermixture of two different races and
cultures.’<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> But Ridgeway is still not quite accurate if he
means to imply that any real blending of <i>ideas</i> had occurred.
We have said that the ideas underlying these different rites
could never be really fused, but they could amalgamate in the
form of an eclectic religion. We may regard it as a confirmation
of our view that Ridgeway has to confess that the fusion
of Achaean and Pelasgian ritual of which there is a solitary
suggestion in the <i>Nekuia</i> does not seem to have established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
itself in Greece very long before the time of Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He
says: ‘According to the Homeric doctrine, once the body
was burned, the spirit returned no more from its dwelling
place with the dead. But on this point Aeschylus held a very
different view. It is evident that by the time of Aeschylus
an eclectic doctrine had been evolved. The Homeric belief
in a separate abode for disembodied spirits was adopted, but
at the same time the ancient doctrine of the constant presence
of the soul in the grave of its body was retained, the gulf
between both doctrines being bridged over by the theory
that even though the body was burned, the soul could return
to its ashes in the grave.’ Now the tomb-offerings made by
Odysseus in the <i>Nekuia</i> do not take place at a tomb, but at the
entrance to Hades. The inference from this fact is <i>not</i> that
there was a blending of Achaean and Pelasgian <i>ideas</i>, in the
cult of the dead, but that it was possible for Achaeans who
practised other forms of Chthonian ritual to perform such rites
when commanded to do so in the realm of Hades, <i>the only
place where their dogmas made such rites intelligible</i>. If the
Achaeans had believed in the Pelasgian doctrine of the presence
of the soul in the tomb, they would normally have made
Chthonian offerings at their tombs. Believing, as they did,
that the souls of the dead lived in Hades, they could only find
meaning in such a rite if they came, as Odysseus came, to the
realm of Hades. We have seen that the Achaeans, and Odysseus
in particular, were familiar with Pelasgian beliefs, and had,
in common with their subjects, certain Chthonian rites. The
<i>Nekuia</i> therefore, instead of proving a fusion of beliefs, seems
to us to suggest, on the contrary, that such a fusion had not
taken place in Homeric Greece.</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Circe instructs Odysseus in the rites which
he must perform when he goes to the ‘dank house of Hades.’
The fact that he has to be instructed in this matter suggests
that it was not a normal procedure in his domestic life. The
same may be said about the command of Circe in regard
to Teiresias. Circe bids Odysseus, when he performs the
Chthonian rite in Hades, to promise that on his return to
Ithaca he will offer up in his home ‘a barren heifer’ and fill
a pyre with treasures, and ‘sacrifice apart, to Teiresias alone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
a black ram without blemish.’ The burning of a mock-pyre,
and the sacrifice of a barren heifer, may be an Achaean rite.
The motive is the placation of the dead, but the rite is quite
different from that regular feeding of the dead which is so
frequent in necromantic magic and in ancestor-worship.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The offering of a black ram to Teiresias is, however, somewhat
different. It is Chthonian, but we connect it especially with
the worship of ‘prophets.’ Teiresias was a prophet of the
old Pelasgian religion. He belongs to a stage in the evolution
of prophecy which is akin to necromancy and witchcraft and
which preceded prophetic colleges, ‘magical secret societies,’<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
or divination by direct inspiration. This latter divination
retained indeed traces of the older rites. Thus in the <i>Ion</i> of
Euripides<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the pilgrims to Apollo at Delphi are required before
consulting the oracle to sacrifice a πέλανος, a Chthonian
offering of meal, honey, and oil. So in Vergil’s story of the
visit of Aristaeus to the underworld, we find that Cyrene tells
Aristaeus to offer, nine days after his return, a Chthonian
sacrifice to an offended prophet, Orpheus:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">We do not therefore agree with H. Seebohm<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> when he says
that the placation of Teiresias proves that offerings to the dead
were regularly made by the Achaeans in their ordinary domestic
life.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Religious Aspect of Homicide</span></h4>

<p>We have pointed out that in Homeric Greece there were,
so to speak, two different religions, which reflected, in their
main features, the social caste-differences of the Achaeans and
the Pelasgians. It has been rightly said that primitive man
creates his gods in his own likeness, and in the absence of any
definite Homeric references to the religious aspect of homicide
we must assume that the two religions of Homeric Greece
adopted, towards homicide, the attitudes of the two corresponding
social strata. Amongst the Achaeans, we have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
homicide was a deed which concerned only the slayer and the
nearest blood-relations of the victim; there was no co-operation
of large groups, no trial, no civic interest in the execution of
vengeance: it was entirely a matter for ‘private settlement’
between the relatives of the slain and the individual slayer.
And this ‘settlement’ was not a payment in money or in kind:
it was a payment in blood, and in blood alone. The Achaeans,
as a caste, had no interest in such ‘crimes’: on the whole,
they regarded bloodshed as a local misfortune, which should
not be aggravated by an extension of the dispute to wider
areas, and therefore they frequently adopted and protected
murder-exiles. We are not then surprised to find that in
Homer the Olympian gods of the Achaean caste manifest no
anger against a murderer.</p>

<p>In the Pelasgian tribal religion we may assume that the
position of the homicide was somewhat different. It required
the payment of wergeld to purchase back the friendship of
tribal gods. But we have seen<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> that for slaying within the
kindred no payment of wergeld could be offered or accepted;
and we have said<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that the penalty of slavery or bondage
was probably inapplicable and that therefore exile was the
normal punishment for bloodshed within the clan. It follows
that the murdered man whose body was interred in the family
tomb would never have come in contact, through worship,
with his kinsman who had slain him. And in this sense we
may accept the dictum of Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> that ‘the hand stained
with blood could not touch sacred objects: the shedder of
blood could not sacrifice.’ Hence it is perhaps significant that,
in Homer, Tlepolemus who, when he had slain his maternal
uncle, went into exile to Rhodes, is said to have been ‘loved
by Zeus,’<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> for by exile he had atoned for his offence. In
ordinary cases of homicide, however, between members of
different clans, we must suppose that the gods of the phratry,
of the tribe, and of the city became reconciled to the slayer
if the relatives of the slain received the customary wergeld.
If then Miss Harrison says<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that ‘so long as primitive man
retains the custom of the blood-feud, so long will he credit his
dead kinsmen with passions like his own,’ she is compelled,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
by her own reasoning, to admit that the ‘ghosts’ of murdered
men, in the tribal wergeld system, did not revolt at the presence
of a murderer, unless he were a kinsman.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> implies that in addition to clan-religion there
was domestic worship. Now this domestic worship was shared
by a husband and wife who normally belonged to two different
clans, and are we to assume that if a husband slew his wife
or a wife her husband, the domestic religion would have compelled
them to go into exile even when the clan could atone
by wergeld? This point we cannot decide with any certainty.
Clytaemnestra, in later legend, offers sacrifice at the
tomb of her murdered husband: her children assert, not that
it is sacrilegious, but only that it is unavailing as a placation.
We think that the tribal penal code did not demand the exile
penalty for homicide of this kind and would have permitted
wergeld. But within the genuine kindred, and especially
within the small kindred, bloodshed, particularly parricide,
was from the earliest times a serious religious offence.</p>

<p>There remain for discussion two problems which most
writers regard as intimately related—namely, the origin and
evolution of the Erinnyes, and the source and significance of
the ritual of homicide-purgation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Erinnyes and Purgation</span></h4>

<p>The Greek word ἐριννύς is probably an adjective meaning
‘angry,’ and should therefore be applicable to any spirit,
whether ghost or god. But Miss Harrison<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> believes that the
word was originally an epithet of a ghost or <i>ker</i>. The following
is a summary of her opinions: The <i>Keres</i> (κῆρες), she thinks,
were primarily ghosts: they were neutral potencies who might
be either quite harmless<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> or baleful bacilli, or good spirits.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
The <i>word</i> Erinnys was originally probably an epithet of <i>ker</i>,
and denoted a ghost-pest, a Poine. The Erinnys primarily is
the <i>ker</i> of a human being unrighteously slain. It is the <i>ker</i>
as Poine.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Thus, because it was a <i>ker</i>, the Erinnys was
primarily a human ghost, but the word came, by a process of
specialisation, to be applied only to such ghosts as are angry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
because they have been murdered.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In Homer, she thinks,
the Erinnyes have passed beyond this stage and are ‘personified
(? deified) almost beyond recognition.’ They are no
longer souls, but the avengers of souls. They have even lost
their exclusive connexion with souls, and are become the
avengers of the moral law, vague equivalents of underworld
Zeus and Persephone.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Now Miss Harrison implicitly connects the Erinnyes with
purgation, since she asserts that ‘purification (<i>i.e.</i> purgation) is
the placation of ghosts.’<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But in Homeric times the ghosts
of murdered men would not, she holds, accept any purgation
sacrifice save the blood of the murderer.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Therefore, in a
certain sense homicide could be purged, and in another sense
it could not be purged in Homeric times!</p>

<p>Homer,<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> she says, does not understand the mystery of
Bellerophon and the Aleïan plain, but Apollodorus<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> reveals
the fact that Bellerophon slew his brother unwittingly and
that he was purified by Proetus. Apollodorus, she thinks, is
unhistorical in speaking of the purification of Bellerophon:
in those old days, she says,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> he could not be purified. But as
murder was a physical infection, Bellerophon had to go to the
Aleïan plain, an alluvial deposit which had recently been
recovered from the sea and which was not therefore included
in the ‘earth’ which was polluted by his deed of blood. The
fallacies of this interpretation will become evident in the
course of our reasoning. At present we will merely point out
(1) that there is no evidence for the assertion that murder was
a ‘physical infection’ in the Homeric age. Everything that
we have said about the Pelasgian wergeld system and the
Achaean protection of murder-exiles proves the contrary;
(2) the plain of wandering, if that is what Homer meant by
Ἀλήϊον, (it may have been a local place-name which conveyed
to him no special meaning,) does not imply an alluvial deposit
of any kind, but possibly a special place which known
murderers, condemned to perpetual exile, were wont to
frequent; (3) Apollodorus may be unhistorical, in speaking of
the purgation of Bellerophon, but so is every Greek writer of
the historical period who attributed purgation to Achaean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
heroes, as Aeschylus, for instance, does, to Orestes; (4) to
explain the absence of references to purgation in Homer by
suggesting that the death of the murderer was the only purgation
of his crime, and to imply that Bellerophon was fleeing
from purgation when he fled from death to the Aleïan plain, is
equivocal and misleading. For a murderer was either purged
or he was not purged; and if a murderer was put to death in
sacrifice, no one could logically speak of him as ‘purged.’</p>

<p>F. de Coulanges seems also to connect the purgation rites
for homicide with the worship of the dead. In the primitive
family group, he says,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> ‘there were domestic morals. The
shedder of blood was no longer allowed to sacrifice or to offer
libations or prayer or to offer the sacred repast.... The hand
stained with blood could no longer touch sacred objects.
To enable a man to renew his worship and to regain possession
of his god, he was required at least to purify himself by an
expiatory ceremony.’ This opinion implies that such rites
were as old as the domestic religion of the Family. The most
serious objection to this implication is that Homer has no
genuine reference to any such ceremony.</p>

<p>Bury, who rightly attributes the origin of purgation rites
for homicide to post-Homeric times, nevertheless connects those
rites with the worship of the Erinnyes and of the Chthonian
deities. ‘Gradually,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> ‘as the worship of the souls
of the dead and of the deities of the underworld developed,
the belief gained ground that he who shed blood was impure
and needed cleansing. Accordingly, when a murderer satisfied
the kinsfolk of the murdered man by paying a fine, he had also
to submit to a process of purification and to satisfy the
Chthonian gods and the Erinnyes or Furies who were, in the
original conception, the souls of the dead clamouring for
vengeance.’ The validity of this conception of the origin
of the Erinnyes will be examined presently. We hope also
to show, at a later stage, that wergeld and ‘pollution’
were mutually destructive.</p>

<p>O. Müller holds<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that the religious rites of expiation and
purification were derived from the remotest times of Grecian
antiquity and were designed to reinstate the slayer in community
of worship with his people. Confronted with the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
that such rites are not mentioned in our Homeric text,
Müller argues,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> firstly, that the reading ἁγνιτέω (= purifier)
instead of ἀφνειοῦ (= rich man) in a passage in the <i>Iliad</i><a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
was the reading of the original text of Homer. He quotes a
scholiast’s opinion to the effect that there is an anachronism
in the verse. Secondly, he holds that the absence of Homeric
references to purgation for homicide is not surprising, because
the poet’s hearers would have taken it for granted as a matter
of course! We must leave our readers to weigh for themselves
the value of this argument. The opinion of the scholiast,
if it proves anything, proves that there was an obviously false
reading interpolated in the text.</p>

<p>Müller conceives<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> purgation (καθαρμός) as a form of expiation
(ἱλασμός) which is closely related to the worship of the
dead and the Erinnyes, and believes that it originated in
the idea that the life of the manslayer (and sometimes the
lives of all his clansmen) must be sacrificed in atonement
for homicide. Such a sacrifice, he thinks, came to be obviated
in course of time, either (1) by the substitution of a surrogate
victim, or (2) by the degradation of the murderer to a
state of servitude, or (3) by wergeld, which was originally
suggested by the new religious custom of accepting the sacrifice
of an animal in lieu of the death of the slayer.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Regarding
the Erinnyes as Chthonian deities to whom this expiation
is offered, he is surprised to find that, in the <i>Eumenides</i> of
Aeschylus, the purgation of Orestes does not lay to rest the
wrath of the Erinnyes. To obviate this difficulty he falls
back on the obviously absurd assumption that Aeschylus, for
dramatic purposes, presents Orestes as not completely purified.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The text of Aeschylus and the text of Homer furnish
the best refutations of such hypotheses.</p>

<p>Glotz is quite definitely of the opinion, and in this we agree
with him, that purgation for homicide was unknown to the
Greeks of Homeric times. In Homer, he says,<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> we find traces
of a purely physical cleansing which is required as a preliminary
to sacrifice: but such words as μιαίνω, μιαρός and μιαίφονος
refer to the victim, not to the slayer.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Homicide is not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
religious offence: the murder exile, received without scruple,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
eats at the same table as other guests, and takes part in libations
and in prayers. The first genuine instance of purgation
for homicide occurs in the <i>Aethiopis</i> of Arctinus of Miletus
(750-700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and the practice continued to develop until it
reached its complete systematisation in the time of Dracon.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
‘Its development,’ says Glotz, ‘coincides with the disappearance
of patriarchal clans and the progress of city life.’ The
purgation-system mediated the transition from ‘private
vengeance’ to ‘social justice.’ It was derived, he thinks,<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
from the Semites. Before its advent in Greece, the Greeks
had long practised Chthonian rites, upon which, so to speak,
it was easily grafted, such rites, for instance, as that which
accompanied cursing or swearing, a rite in which ‘purging’
water was thrown over the hands of those about to swear,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
or that which was associated with solemn reconciliations after
feuds or enmities.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Hence, says Glotz, it came about, by
a natural transition, that in historical times the preliminary
pleas on oath of the accuser and the accused in cases of
homicide were taken at the altar of the Erinnyes, and it was
at this altar that sacrifice was offered by the defendant
acquitted of murder by the Areopagus and by the returned
exile who had paid the penalty of involuntary homicide.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Returning to Miss Harrison’s theory of the Erinnyes, we
are of the opinion that the epithet ἐριννύς was originally
equally applicable to all supernatural beings, whether ghosts
or gods, but that before the time of Homer the epithet came to
be limited to such divinities as were, for some reason, difficult
to placate by the ordinary magic of placation.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The elemental
forces which were deified, as we think, before the advent of
the Achaeans, developed, under Achaean influence, a neutral
and capricious nature, varying in moods of sun and shower,
of calm and storm, like ‘typical men of the other world.’
Like men, they could be placated by gifts and by hospitable
entertainment. But the ghost-worship which characterised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the Pelasgian stratum was of a much more gloomy and terrible
nature. Miss Harrison thinks<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that Homer exalted the
Olympians but caused the bad aspect of Chthonian deities
and ghosts to be unduly emphasised. Though the Erinnyes
are relegated by Homer to Erebus, yet he does not think of
them as ghosts, but as minor deities who carry out instructions
from their superiors. They are connected with Zeus
(of the underworld), with Ge (the Earth), with the Sun (who,
like Zeus, has an underworld aspect, for he too goes down
every evening to Hades in the west), and with the Moirae
who, though originally agricultural personifications of the
Seasons, rapidly became synonymous with Destiny itself,
and in Homer are superior even to Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It is especially
in the ceremonies of cursing and of swearing that these
Chthonian powers are invoked in Chthonian ritual. We have
already<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> indicated Miss Harrison’s error in associating the
Achaeans exclusively with Olympian, and the Pelasgians with
Chthonian ritual. She is, we think, equally mistaken in
assuming that the pre-Achaean Erinnys was an irrational being,
predominantly animal in form, which had to await the coming
of the humanising Achaeans before it assumed a respectable
‘personified’ shape. We think the Pelasgians retained quite
faithfully the original anthropomorphic conception of the
Erinnyes, while the Achaeans merely regarded them as minor
deities who obediently submitted to ‘Olympian’ authority.
The precise nature of the Pelasgian cult of the Erinnyes in
Homeric Greece is rather difficult to define. In the Pelasgian
religion there was but a small and indescribable difference
between ghosts and gods, between minor deities and greater
deities. It is probable that the Pelasgians practised, occasionally,
Olympian ritual—for instance, at public festivals and in
civic worship; but in the local domestic worship of the clan,
the phratry, and the tribe, their placation of ancestors gave a
predominantly Chthonian tone to their whole religious outlook.
Hence their Erinnyes, also, though originally spirits which were
angry but placable, easily became spirits, whether ghosts or
gods, whose wrath was almost implacable. But the Achaeans
did not realise the nature of these Erinnyes: and hence in
Homer they almost assume the role of ministering spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
sent to warn or to punish. They are not wicked and malicious,
like the Harpies or the Sirens. Thus they are much more
human and less, so to speak, diabolical than the real Pelasgian
Erinnyes, and this is, perhaps, what Miss Harrison meant to
convey when she said<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> that ‘in Homer they are <i>personified</i>
beyond recognition.’ The Achaeans could not appreciate the
terrible potentialities of the angry ghost-god of the Pelasgians,
for the simple reason that they did not worship the ghosts of
departed ancestors or any kind of ghosts.</p>

<p>It would, however, be a serious error to suppose that the
Pelasgian Erinnyes were as formidable and as implacable as
the Erinnyes of post-Homeric times. Moreover, it is gratuitous
to assume that ghosts were primarily and necessarily angry
because they had been murdered. There is no evidence that
homicide in Pelasgian times generated implacable Erinnyes.
We admit, with Miss Harrison,<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> that primitive man credits
his dead kinsman with passions like his own. But we have
already pointed out<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that if the passions of primitive man
are checked and controlled by a tribal society which tramples
upon individual instincts, and acts in a collective capacity,
if wergeld, according to tribal and early civic law, permits
a slayer to remain at home and guarantees him immunity
from vengeance while his hands are still wet with blood,
we cannot reasonably ascribe to ‘dead kinsmen’ a fierce and
implacable desire for vengeance.</p>

<p>How comes it then, we may ask, that so many writers
regard the evolution of early Greek blood-vengeance, and a
corresponding evolution in the blood-thirst of the Erinnyes,
as a transition from the wild to the tame, from the fierce to
the gentle, from the barbarously savage to the rationally
civilised? The reason is twofold. First of all, previous writers
have not distinguished between the tribally controlled Pelasgians
and the bellicose Achaeans, and have therefore misinterpreted
the text of Homer. Secondly, many writers have
regarded the dark age of chaos of post-Homeric Hesiodic days
as a valid picture for early Greece as a whole. This confusion
has not only affected modern writers, but it also affected the
Greeks of historical times. The various legends of post-Homeric
times came to be regarded as a proper medium for the interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
of Homeric saga. The Athenians of the Periclean age
were compelled to regard as barbarians their forebears of pre-Draconian
times. It is most important to bear this point in
mind, in view of our subsequent analysis of homicide in Attic
tragedy. We do not assert that all the legends of Attic
tragedy are ‘unhistorical.’ We shall see that in Euripides
many legends suggest a reference to a period which we
may describe as Homeric or, at least, pre-Hesiodic, and are so
faithful a reproduction of that age that they must be either
attributed to the most skilful conscious archaising on the part
of the dramatist, or regarded as genuine legends which had
been transmitted with the least possible adulteration. But
most of the legends which we find in the Attic tragedians and
in the later epic and prose writers are either adulterated saga,
or inventions framed in imitation of such saga. To base a
theory of social or religious evolution on such legends is
obviously to build upon sand.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the confusion which may thus arise,
we will cite the legend of the Boeotian Athamas which is given
by Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and by Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Pausanias says that
Athamas, King of Orchomenus, slew his son Learchus after
having made an abortive attempt to sacrifice his son Phrixus
to Zeus Laphistius on a neighbouring mountain. Herodotus,
however, says that Phrixus was slain by Athamas, and that,
as a punishment for this act, an oracle decreed that the
Achaeans of Thessaly, to whom Athamas had fled, should
purge their country by slaying Athamas in sacrifice. When
they were on the point of offering up Athamas, as a ‘scapegoat’
for <i>their</i> sins, Cytissorus, son of Phrixus, arrived from Colchis
and saved him! The natural avenger of Phrixus became the
deliverer of his slayer, even in defiance of the oracle! The
gods, now seriously annoyed, forbade the descendants of
Cytissorus to enter the Prytaneum of the city, and a mock
human sacrifice was regularly offered to make amends to the
gods for their loss. We believe that this legend is merely
an attempt to explain two mock human sacrifices which
survived, in Boeotia and in Thessaly, in historical times, and
that the fact of their contiguity led to the association of Athamas
with Phrixus in the legend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>Stories of this kind have suggested the theory that the
rites of homicide-purgation originated in human sacrifice:
but they are merely aetiological. Moreover the survival, in
historical times, in barbarous countries on the outskirts of
Greece, of actual human sacrifice, and the mock sacrifices of
human beings which were offered at certain festivals in various
places, helped to confirm what stories of actual human sacrifice
in post-Homeric legend, and stories of bloodshed which could
be interpreted as human sacrifices in the Homeric poems,
all seemed to suggest, namely, the opinion that all the Greeks
of pre-Draconian days practised human sacrifice and were
only induced to cease from the practice by the device of a
surrogate victim. But there is no trace of real human sacrifice
in Homer, certainly no trace of the sacrifice of a murderer’s life
to gods who demanded it.</p>

<p>We shall see later that, in the Apolline code, death was
probably the invariable penalty for kin-slaying,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and there
was no ‘purgation’: but in other cases purgation was
possible, and in the purgation ceremony an animal was slain.
The conclusion which is suggested <i>prima facie</i> by these facts,
namely, that at one time human sacrifice was the only purgation
for homicide, is not necessarily correct. We believe it is
incorrect. We agree with Glotz<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> in deriving the purgation
rite from Chthonian sacrifice in its general aspect. In such
sacrifice, originally, human beings were probably offered,
prior to, contemporarily with, and even subsequent to, the
adoption of animal sacrifice. We cannot legitimately assume
that the latter supplanted the former. Glotz points out that
religion, being conservative, tends to preserve in ritual elements
which civilisation has abandoned. Hence arose the mock-rites
of human sacrifice which took place in historical times.</p>

<p>The belief that homicide-purgation originated in the sacrificial
slaying of the murderer was encouraged by the similarity which
existed between the rites of homicide-purgation and the ordinary
ritual of Chthonian expiation. We shall see later that, in the
ceremonial of purification which was applied to persons guilty
of homicide, from the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards, the blood
of a slain animal was poured over the hands of the slayer, and
allowed to flow away into the sea or into a running stream.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Thus, homicide-purgation (καθαρμός) easily came to be regarded
as a kind of expiation (ἱλασμός); but it differs fundamentally
in meaning from expiation, inasmuch as it is symbolical of the
fact that a social or religious obligation has been discharged,
rather than of the fact that it is being thereby discharged. The
sacrifice of an ox or a sheep or a ram to a god or a ghost was
<i>in itself</i> a payment or a retribution. But homicide-purgation
(καθαρμός) was never permitted <i>until</i> the slayer had re-established
his normal social equilibrium, had suffered the penalty
prescribed by law, namely exile, temporary or perpetual, and
was ready to resume religious communion with his fellow-men.
Since, therefore, homicide-purgation was rather a symbol of
reconciliation than a medium of expiation, it was more closely
allied to the rites which accompanied the swearing of oaths,<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
the giving of pledges and the making of contracts. The
animal on which an oath was sworn could not be eaten: so,
too, the pig or the lamb by whose blood a murderer was
‘cleansed’ could not be eaten. Now it is unfortunate that
such ceremonies, which were really symbolic of reconciliation,
should have been so similar to the general ritual of religious
expiation that they could easily be confused. There is a vast
difference in meaning between reconciliation and the aversion
of evil, yet all these ideas were confused in the general system
of Chthonian ritual. As an illustration of this confusion we
may cite a passage from Vergil, in which is described a rite
which is really an ‘aversion of evil,’ a kind of purgation by
anticipation. Urging the farmer to be religious in the interest
of his crops, he says<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">cui<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> tu lacte favos et miti dilue Baccho,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The milk, honey and wine here mentioned are the characteristic
offerings in the placation of ghosts.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The rite was easily
transferred to Demeter or Ceres, the Chthonian goddess, because
of the natural tendency of Chthonianism to identify the ghost
with the god. The ceremony of carrying a victim round the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
crops was not a symbol of atonement for moral guilt so much as
an aversion of quasi-physical evil spirit which caused sterility.</p>

<p>Athenaeus,<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> describing the ‘purgation’ of an Arcadian
city which was necessitated by the visit of certain citizens from
a town which was polluted by bloodshed, says: ‘They made purgation
of the city, carrying “victims” round the city territory.’
The similarity of this ceremony to the ‘aversion’ rite described
by Vergil is obvious. Yet this ceremony is somewhat different
from the purgation of an actual homicide, which we shall describe
more fully later.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In the former a number of victims
are slain; in the latter, only one. Now, if homicide-purgation
originated in human sacrifice, and if, as Müller maintains,<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
wergeld was suggested to men by the <i>de facto</i> acceptance,
on the part of the gods, of an animal substitute, why was the
number of animals sacrificed in homicide-purgation limited to
<i>one</i>? Why did men not offer to the gods at least the <i>saraad</i>
or insult-price,<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which generally consisted of a number of
animals? The sacrifice of only one animal in such a ceremony
cannot be explained by Müller’s hypothesis. It can, however,
be made intelligible if we assume a direct derivation of the rites
of homicide-purgation from the ritual which accompanied
solemn oaths and reconciliations. In such a ritual, only a
single victim was slain: its death was a kind of inductive
symbol of the fate of its slayer, if he ever proved false to his
oath. But in ceremonies of general purgation, such as
Athenaeus describes, there was an element of expiation, or
aversion, and hence there was no limit to the number of victims,
for there was no such limit in expiatory sacrifice of any kind.</p>

<p>We shall see later how, in historical times, purgation for
homicide was inadmissible in cases of kin-slaying, unless the
dying man forgave; even then the slayer had to be exiled for
one year before he could be purged in his homeland: in cases
of wilful murder, purgation of the slayer in his own country
was impossible at any time, but was possible, if not compulsory,
abroad: in cases of manslaughter, purgation could take place
at home when the conditions of exile and of the ‘appeasement’
of the slain man’s relatives had been fulfilled. From such
regulations we can obviously infer that purgation was a symbol
of reconciliation, but not an expiation of guilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Homeric and the Tragic Erinnys</span></h4>

<p>We must now contrast what we may call the Homeric
Erinnys with the Erinnys of post-Homeric times and with the
‘tragic’ Erinnys. In the course of our discussion we hope
to suggest some reasons, more satisfactory, even if they be more
complex, than that which Müller<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> gives, for the refusal of
the Erinnyes in the Oresteian legends of Attic tragedy to recognise
the purgation of Orestes until they assume the rôle of
Semnai Theai or Eumenides. In our view there are just two
reasons for this refusal: one is the fact that the purgation-rites
for homicide were a symbol of reconciliation, not with
ghosts, but with gods: the other is the fact that the Erinnyes
of Attic tragedy are a complex product, reflecting the attitude
of the relatives of the slain at different periods, and from
different points of view, in the post-Homeric era. We shall
see later that there must have been several different variants
of the Oresteian legend. The act of Orestes would have been
approved or condemned according as social custom, at any
given epoch, recognised the right of Apollo to command or
to justify in advance the slaying of Clytaemnestra, or the right
of a State court to approve, or at least to condone, an act which
tribal society would have probably condemned.</p>

<p>We may thus summarise what we conceive to have been
the different stages in the evolution of the ‘tragic’ Erinnyes.
We must distinguish clearly between (1) the Pelasgian Erinnys;
(2) the Achaean Erinnys; (3) the post-Homeric pre-Apolline
Erinnys, and (4) the Apolline or historical Erinnys. In
Homer there is a fusion of the first and second conceptions.
In Attic tragedy there is a most disheartening confusion of all
four conceptions. We must remember that the Erinnyes were
not ordinary deities possessing a stereotyped cult. Having
attained divinity largely through the personification or deification
of an abstract cultus-epithet, their nature was liable to
vary according to men’s interpretation of the meaning and origin
of the epithet, and their forms could be freely fashioned by the
minds of poets and of legend-makers.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>(1) In regard to the Pelasgian Erinnyes, we have suggested
that they were divinities of different degrees of rank in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Chthonian religion. They did not visit their wrath on a
murderer if he paid the tribal penalty, or even on the slayer
of a kinsman, unless he remained in contact with the domestic
worship of his dead relative.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> There was no ‘purgation’
for homicide: because homicide was not yet an offence against
<i>the greater gods of the State</i>. The exile or death of a murderer
or the payment of wergeld appeased, of itself, the Erinnys
of the slain: to refuse to accept wergeld was impossible, in
the organisation of the tribe.</p>

<p>(2) The Achaean Erinnys was an eclectic product. It was
not Homer who personified<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the Erinnys because it was already
personified, though in that vague collective nameless manner
in which alone a cultus-epithet can be deified. The Achaeans
conceived the Erinnyes as gods. For them there are only
gods and men: there are no ghosts or abstractions in the
galaxy of supernatural beings. The Achaean Erinnys has
lost its connexion with ghost-terror, though it retains sufficient
traces of its Chthonian importance to be treated with considerable
respect. It is merely a subordinate deity which
executes the decrees of Olympian gods, but its association with
Zeus and the Moirae suggests the greater dignity which it
enjoyed in Chthonian religion. The connexion of the Erinnys
with curses is essentially Chthonian. All castes in Homer
use the ritual of swearing, but we cannot say how far the
Achaeans understood the ideas underlying the rite. The
curse of a father or a mother was particularly terrible in
the Pelasgian domestic religion. But we cannot suppose that
the Achaean respect for parents, or their dread of curses,
was as great or as profound as that of the Pelasgians. The
Achaean Zeus himself hurled to Tartarus his aged father
Kronos.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Hence the Homeric references to parents’ curses,
such as are found in the stories of the Achaean Phoenix
and the Achaean Meleager, indicate probably an assimilation
of Pelasgian ideas.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But the literary heirloom which the
poet of the Achaeans bequeathed to Greece helped to beget
a false conception of the Achaean Erinnys in the minds
of later poets. The Achaean mode of blood-vengeance and
their desire of blood for blood caused later legend-makers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
attribute a veritable blood-thirst to the Erinnyes of murdered
Achaeans.</p>

<p>(3) The post-Homeric pre-Apolline Erinnys—a divine being
whose nature can only be inferred by the logic of elimination—reflects
in a more emphatic manner the blood-thirst of the
slain. In the relaxation of Achaean military discipline which
followed the Trojan war: in the great invasions and migrations,
and in the demoralisation of clan-control, in a chaotic
society such as Hesiod describes,<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> where force is the only
law, and justice, virtue, honour, hospitality, loyalty and
fraternal love have vanished from the earth, the Erinnys
came to assume a diabolical aspect: murder was confused
with vengeance; the anger of impotent avengers became implacable:
and inexorable hatred was attributed to the Erinnyes
of the slain. At this period the gods were credited with an
approval of collective punishment<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> such as men themselves
practised. Nemesis became a god.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Kronos is now said to
have devoured his children, and Rhea, their mother, inflamed
the Erinnyes against him.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The blood-offerings which from
time immemorial had been laid at the tomb of the dead were
now interpreted, not as a resuscitation of the dead for purposes
of necromancy or for the production of fertility, but, in the
case of murdered dead, as the satisfaction of an unquenched
thirst for blood. Curses became more frequent and more
terrible than in days when tribal law or military control
rendered recourse to religious sanctions less necessary. To
this period we attribute the prevalence of customs of which
some survived to historical times, while others soon became
obsolete: we refer to the custom of writing curses on tombstones,
the custom of planting a spear in the grave,<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and the
custom of μασχαλισμός, or partial mutilation of a corpse.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
To those days, rather than to historical Greece, apply the words
of the Chorus in the <i>Electra</i> of Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The streaming blood of those who made them die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">In the <i>Ion</i> of Euripides<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> we are told that around the
Omphalos, or Sacred Stone, were figures of the Gorgons. One
editor<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> of this play remarks that these figures suggested to
Aeschylus the dramatic forms of his Erinnyes. We are much
more inclined to believe this, than to suppose, with Miss
Harrison<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> or with Verrall,<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> that Aeschylus invented the
dramatic form of the ‘tragic’ Erinnys. We shall see later<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
that Aeschylus conceived the Erinnyes as Titans, as rebels
against Zeus and the Olympians. Whence came this rebel-rôle
of the Erinnyes? The answer will, perhaps, be more
intelligible if we explain the nature of the Apolline or
‘historical’ Erinnys.</p>

<p>(4) We are not concerned here with the nature of the
cult of the Erinnyes in historical Greece. We seek rather to
describe the Erinnyes as they were moulded in the minds
of poets and of legend-makers in accordance with conceptions
of homicide which were modified by the Apolline doctrine of
‘pollution’ and ‘purgation,’ and by the evolution of state-control.
We must postpone to later parts of our work the
details of our theory, and the more complete demonstration
of its validity. We will merely give here, as it were by anticipation,
a summary of our conclusions. The doctrine of
‘pollution’ which, as we think, came to Greece about 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
and which was gradually adopted in most Greek states under
the rule of the ‘aristocracy of birth,’ declared the homicide
to be an enemy to the gods of the State. His presence, in
his native State, or in the country of the slain, brought upon
the whole community plagues and pestilences and all those
evils which the primitive mind attributes to divine anger.
In our opinion, such a doctrine was incompatible with any
further continuation of the wergeld system which had
survived the age of chaos. The abolition of wergeld, at the
dictate of Apollo, the national prophet-god of ‘aristocratic’
Greece, was a change which struck at the root of the great
tribal principle of retribution to the relatives of the slain.
Before the new doctrine acquired the prestige of traditional
custom, we should expect that a feeling of revolt would have
manifested itself in the sentiments of the old kindred of
the clans. Such a revolt would have been reflected, in legend,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
as an attribute of the Erinnyes of the slain. This conception
of a revolting Erinnys will explain the Titanic rôle of the Furies
in Aeschylus, and their refusal to recognise the purgation of
Orestes by Apollo.</p>

<p>There was another factor, too, which may have helped to
give vitality and realism to the rebellious rôle of the ‘tragic’
Erinnyes, especially in Euripides. We shall see<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that the
Apolline doctrine did not abolish every form of compensation.
The relatives of a person involuntarily slain were
entitled to ‘appeasement,’ were, perhaps, permitted under
certain conditions to enter into what is known as ‘private
settlement’—though usually before ‘appeasement’ a certain
period of exile was necessary. Now if, as some maintain,<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
the ‘appeasement’ depended entirely on the will of the
relatives, and if the relatives had to be unanimous in accepting
the gifts or presents which constituted ‘appeasement,’ it is
clear that one single relative could have extorted enormous
sums of money, or otherwise have compelled the manslayer
to abide in perpetual exile. We shall argue, later, that the
regular duration of exile for manslaughter was one year, and
that this custom implies the influence of local control, on the
part of judges or magistrates, directed against the right to
refuse ‘appeasement’ on the part of a slain man’s relatives.
Such a control would naturally have produced irritation and
dissatisfaction which, again, might have been reflected in
men’s conception of the Erinnyes. We shall see that at least
one legend of Orestes conceived his deed as involuntary kin-slaying.
It was probably this legend which represented some
of the Furies as still implacable when the Areopagus trial had
declared Orestes ‘not guilty,’ or rather, immune from further
punishment.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The main difficulty connected with the ‘appeasement’ of
the Oresteian Erinnyes arises from the fact that they are not
unanimous in their opinions about Orestes, and that some of
them—the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra—are in violent conflict
with the official opinion of Apollo. At a later stage we shall
be in a position to explain this difficulty more clearly. At
present we will merely cite a law of Plato which is probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
based on the old traditions of patriarchal tribes (as they were
modified in course of time by Apollinism), and which forbids
the slayer of a kinsman who slays under the influence of
passion, ever to return to domestic communion with his kindred,
even though he may return to his native state and undergo
‘purgation.’ We refer to this law because it is possible to
interpret the act of Orestes, from Apollo’s standpoint, not as
fully justified but rather as in a sense involuntary, being
extenuated by a religious command, as ‘passion’ would have
extenuated it. Plato says<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>: ‘If a father or a mother in a
passion kills a son or daughter ... let them be exiled for
three years and be “purged,” but, on return, let the husband
be divorced from the wife and the wife from the husband ...
and not dwell in communion with (the family) ... or share
with them in sacred rites.’ Now, in the Apolline system it is
probable that the murder of a husband by his wife was of equal
gravity with kin-murder which was punishable with death.
Coulanges points out<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> that the wife belonged to the domestic
religion of her husband, even though she did not belong to
his kindred. In the Pelasgian wergeld system husband and
wife are ‘strangers’ in matters of homicide; but in the
Apolline religious system they are members of the same hearth
and home. Moreover, in historical times failure to obey the
Apolline laws laid the delinquent open to a charge of impiety,
for which the penalty of death might be inflicted. There is a
suggestion of these legal viewpoints in Apollo’s attitude when
he tells<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> the Erinnyes that Clytaemnestra, the murderess
of her husband, was justly slain, and that Orestes would have
merited death if he had not slain her; and in the answer
of the Erinnyes concerning the act of Clytaemnestra, that
‘her slaying was not kindred bloodshed’<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>; and that Orestes,
the slayer of his mother, must be pursued until he dies!<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Now, Plato suggests that in the Apolline code exclusion from
domestic religion attended the ‘extenuated’ slaying of a parent
by a son, even when the dying parent formally ‘forgave.’<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Apart from the impossibility of the supposition of a formal
‘forgiveness’ of Orestes on the part of Clytaemnestra, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
clear that the Erinnyes of the Apolline era would have naturally
objected to the presence of Orestes in the home of his fathers.
Thus they say, in the <i>Eumenides</i><a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His mother’s blood upon the earth he spilled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall he in Argos dwell, his father’s home?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What phratry-altar can him e’er receive?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What common lustral water can he share?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Orestes, fearing the Erinnyes of his father who naturally
and legally, in the Apolline system, pursue the relative who
fails to avenge, and who is ‘polluted’ almost equally with the
murderer, cries out, in the <i>Choephoroe</i><a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The darkling arrow of the dead that flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From kindred souls abominably slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should harass and unman me till the state</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should drive me forth, with brand upon my body.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So vexed, so banished, I should have no share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wine or dear libations, but unseen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My father’s wrath should drive me from all altars.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, the Erinnyes seem to reflect the conflict of opinions
and of sentiments which would frequently have arisen amongst
the relatives of the slain concerning the guilt of a kinsman
who had slain a kinsman. They also, unfortunately, suggest
the co-existence of conceptions of blood-vengeance which are
really to be attributed to different periods of time and to widely
different types of civilisation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section I</span></h4>

<p>Less than a hundred years<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> after the Trojan war, and some
time about the year 1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the great and glorious rule of
the Achaeans over Greece came to an end. ‘Greece,’ as Leaf
puts it,<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ‘relapsed from the temporary union imposed upon
it by its rulers into its normal congeries of loosely coherent
cantons.’ The Achaeans did not, of course, entirely disappear,
but they ceased to maintain that unified control and domination
over Greece which they had enjoyed for two or three
centuries. The causes of this change are variously estimated.
Historical analogies, such as that of the Normans in England
and in Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> suggest in general the brief duration of such a
hegemony. ‘The domination of a small military caste over
a large subject population contains of necessity,’ says Leaf,<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
‘the germs of its own destruction....’ ‘The <i>Iliad</i> itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
gives us vividly, in the portrait of Agamemnon, the inherent
weakness of all hereditary military despotisms.... The
time came ... whether through the effort of the Trojan war
which had reduced their numbers, or through lack of moral
grit following on too long a tenure of power, when the Achaeans
had to cast in their lot with their former vassals ... the
group system resumed its sway and the Achaeans were drawn
into it.’<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ridgeway, arguing from analogous instances,
attributes the decay of Achaean vigour partly to climatic
influences, partly to the enervating effects of luxury and
power. In regard to this latter factor, he says<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>: ‘It is a
known fact that the upper classes in all countries have an
inevitable tendency to die out ... the dwindling of the
master races in the Mediterranean, whether they were Achaeans,
Celts, Goths, Norsemen or Turks, must be in part accounted
for by the mere fact that they formed in each case the upper
and ruling class, and could therefore afford to lead a life
of luxury which was the very bane of their race.’ For
our part we are convinced with Leaf<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that ‘an invasion
of Southern Greece by rude tribes from the north or
north-west swept away the Achaean civilisation after the
Homeric age’; that a military confederation of hereditary
monarchs and nobles, such as that of the Achaeans, could
not have lost its unified control if these inherent factors of
disintegration had not been supplemented by an invasion
from without.</p>

<p>O. Müller<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has pointed out that in Thessaly, the former
realm of Peleus and Achilles, there existed in historical times
three strata of social and political privilege: (1) the Thessalians,
post-Homeric immigrants, who ruled directly over the central
territory, including the towns of Larissa, Crannon, Pharsalus,
Iolcus. (2) Perioeci or semi-independent vassals, such as the
Perrhaebians, the Magnesians, and the Phthiotian Achaeans,
who paid tribute and were bound to assist in war. (3) Penestae,
of Pelasgian stock, like the Helots of Sparta, who cultivated
the land and served in war, who had private rights but no
political privileges, who were, in a word, serfs, but not slaves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
He mentions, further,<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that the Achaeans of the north coast
of the Peloponnese remained in towns and fortified strongholds,
keeping entirely aloof from the natives; they were still conquerors
here, though they had become vassals elsewhere. In
Sparta there appears to have been a mingling of Achaeans
and Dorians. Thucydides says<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that here ‘the few rule over
the many, having obtained sovereignty by victory in the
field.’ That this victory was not very decisive is suggested by
the view, which is commonly held,<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that one of the two Royal
families of Sparta was Achaean. The Perioeci of Laconia were
always considered Achaeans<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; there were about a hundred
towns of Laconian Perioeci, both inland and on the coast;
they paid tribute to Sparta, but they had a monopoly of trade
and commerce, and in the time of Nabis were liberated and
federated as independent states of the Achaean league.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
Helots, of course, were serfs. They tilled the soil, and lived
in hamlets which made up the greater part of the town of
Sparta. They were probably Pelasgians, though they are called
Achaeans by Theopompus.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Similarly, in Argos and in Corinth
there are traces of pre-Dorian peoples who can probably be
regarded as including some remnants of the Homeric Achaeans.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Leaf suggests<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that the Dorians may have followed methods
of conquest similar to those of the Achaeans, yet he has no
doubt that they were identical in social organisation with the
Pelasgians.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> ‘Hellenism as we know it,’ he says, ‘is founded
on tribal distinctions, beginning with the great racial divisions
of Dorian, Ionian, and Aeolian in the wide sense—the general
name for all which did not belong to the other two;—passing
thence to the local state, Athenian, Spartan and the rest.
Each of these again is divided internally by tribe, clan, and
family systems of the most complicated nature. Upon these
ramifying subdivisions is based the polity, and largely the
religion, of classical Greece.’</p>

<p>This statement is of first-rate importance for our theories
concerning post-Homeric homicide. It means, in effect, that,
in spite of conflicts and migrations, the dominant Hellenic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
or post-Homeric Greek society was based on clan and tribal
organisations similar to those of the early Pelasgians. The
militarist Achaeans of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> must then be
regarded as a solitary accidental ephemeral phantom which
crossed the stage of Grecian history never to return. The
Achaeans who survived the invasions either remained in
isolated groups as in Achaea and in South Thessaly, where
they seem to have preserved for a time their military character,<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
though they may, in course of centuries, have evolved the
mechanism of clan life: or they became subject Perioeci, and
were rapidly merged in tribal organisations, or they were
accepted as partners in government, as at Sparta, at Argos, at
Corinth, and at Sicyon, and, like the Roman <i>Patres minorum
gentium</i>, developed along the lines of tribal society. Their
peculiar Homeric character disappeared: they were Hellenised—which
is to say, with Leaf,<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that they were ‘drawn into’ the
‘group-system,’ which, after Homer, ‘resumed its sway.’</p>

<p>It was perhaps because of special circumstances that
<i>Sparta</i> developed along peculiar lines of a quasi-Achaean and
non-Hellenic kind. Thus, Müller holds<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that the Spartans
represent a continuation of the heroic age, a system of military
rule over agricultural classes. So Holm<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> says that ‘The
Spartan monarchy was a continuation of that of the Homeric
age, only its authority was more strictly defined and became
gradually more limited.’ Grote,<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> criticising the opinion of
Müller, who holds that the Spartans were typical Dorians, maintains
that the ‘institutions of Sparta were peculiar to herself,
distinguishing her not less from Argos, Corinth, Megara ...
than from Athens or Thebes.’ Crete, he says, was ‘the only
other portion of Greece in which there prevailed institutions
in many respects analogous, yet still dissimilar.’ The creator
or inventor of the peculiar Spartan character, was, he thinks,
Lycurgus. We consider these opinions much more probable
than that of Gilbert,<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who believes that the three Dorian tribes,
known as Hylleis, Dymanes, Pamphyloi, existed in the earlier
days, at Sparta, as a social organisation. The reference of
Demetrius of Scepsis (about 100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) to the existence of twenty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
phratries and nine tribes at Sparta, gives, of course,
no basis for assuming their existence in post-Homeric times.
We have a special reason for emphasising the peculiarity of
Spartan institutions. A solitary reference in Xenophon<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to
a penalty of perpetual exile for involuntary homicide at Sparta,
in contrast with the well-known penalty of temporary exile
at Athens, has been taken to justify the opinion that the
murder-laws of Athens were peculiar to herself. But, in our
view, the peculiarity of Sparta<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> militates against the validity
of such a conclusion. We hope to prove more clearly at a
later stage that this conclusion is false.</p>

<p>The social evolution of post-Homeric Boeotia is a subject
on which a wide diversity of opinions appears to exist.
Ridgeway<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> thinks that the Boeotians were Achaeans: Leaf<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
supposes that they were Thessalians: Müller<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> believes that
they were Pelasgian Aeolians driven out of the land which
was afterwards called Thessaly, by invading Thessalians.
Leaf argues<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that the Achaeans did not occupy Boeotia at
the time of their domination in Greece, but we do not see why
they may not have occupied that district at a later date. Bury<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
contrasts the ‘Boeotian conquerors’ with the ‘older Greek
inhabitants’ of Boeotia: Hogarth<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> distinguishes between
Aryan Boeotians and the non-Aryan Asiatic Cadmeans of
Thebes. We cannot attempt to decide between these various
opinions, and, fortunately, it is not necessary that we should
do so. We have indicated the probable fate of the Achaeans
after the fall of Troy, and for the rest we may be satisfied with
the description of Thucydides.<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>‘The country which is now called Hellas was not,’ he says,
‘regularly settled in ancient times. The people were migratory
and readily left their homes whenever they were overpowered
by numbers. There was no commerce ... the several
tribes cultivated their own soil just enough to obtain a maintenance
from it. They were always ready to migrate. The
richest districts were most constantly changing their inhabitants.’
Thucydides mentions, as rich districts, Thessaly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Boeotia and the Peloponnese (except Arcadia). Attica, however,
of which the soil was poor and thin, enjoyed, he says,
a long freedom from civil strife and retained its original inhabitants.
Hence ‘... the Athenians<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> were the first who
laid aside arms and adopted an easier and more luxurious
mode of life.’ Again he points out<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that ‘... Even in the
age which followed the Trojan War, Hellas was still in a state
of ferment and settlement and had no time for peaceful growth.
The return of the Hellenes from Troy after their long absence
caused many changes; quarrels too arose in every city, and
those who were expelled went and founded other cities ...
a considerable time elapsed before Hellas became finally
settled ... after a while she recovered tranquillity and began
to send out colonies.’</p>

<p>Glotz<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> paints a lurid picture of the homicide customs of
what he calls the Middle Ages of Hellenism (Le Moyen Age
hellénique). ‘Passé, le temps où toutes les forces du groupe
se coalisaient spontanément, instantanément, contre toute
agression, d’où qu’elle vint. Le meurtrier riche et puissant
n’avait plus à craindre un aussi grand nombre de vengeurs:
il n’était plus contraint de fuir par un aussi formidable soulèvement
de haines.... Le meurtrier d’un parent pouvait avoir
des accomplices ou trouver des complaisants parmi ses plus
proches.... Ainsi les homicides commis à l’intérieur d’une
famille étaient moins sûrement punis à l’époque où
s’organisèrent les tribunaux de l’Etat que dans la période
précédente, où la justice du γένος avait encore toute son
efficacité.... Il y eut un moment où vraiment, dans certains
cas, le parricide n’avait rien à redouter d’aucune justice.’ The
references which Glotz here makes to the control exercised
by the clan in cases of kin-slaying are quite in harmony with
our theory of the nature of Pelasgian homicide customs, but
they are quite inconsistent with Glotz’s general hypothesis
as to the nature of Homeric blood-vengeance. This inconsistency
is to be explained by the absence of that distinction
between the Achaean and the Pelasgian attitude to homicide
which we have made the basis of our reasoning. Moreover,
Glotz is not quite sound in supposing that the age of chaos
began about the year 800 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The date of Hesiod is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
generally regarded as approximately 850 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the condition
of things which he depicts must have existed for a considerable
time before that date. It was not a temporary or spasmodic
condition of things. Substituting, therefore, the dates 1100
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> for Glotz’s figures 800 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as the time-limits
of the age of chaos, we may accept as trustworthy
Glotz’s description of the Dark Ages. He quotes a Hesiodic
passage to which we have already called attention.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> ‘Rien
que désunion de père à enfants, d’hôte à hôte, d’ἑταῖρος à
ἑταῖρος: plus d’amour fraternel, comme jadis. Vite on jette
l’opprobre sur les parents qui vieillissent: on leur parle un
langage dur et insultant, impie, sans souci de la vindicte
divine: on refuse à la vieillesse de parents les vivres qu’on a
reçus d’eux dans l’enfance: car on ne connaît que le droit
de la force.... Pas d’égards pour la bonne foi, la justice,
la vertu: au crime et à la violence tous les honneurs.’ Into
this chaotic condition, he says,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> came the new religious
doctrine of homicide as a pollution. ‘La religion force la
société à intervenir dans les affaires de sang intrafamiliales,
et la société agit non pas contre le coupable mais contre la
famille qui refuse d’agir.... Une idée nouvelle se fait jour
dans l’esprit des Grecs, l’idée de la souillure qui s’attache à
l’homicide ... la purification du meurtrier n’est pas une
coutume primitive ... n’était pas connue à l’époque
homérique.’</p>

<p>In many such passages Glotz implies that in the Hesiodic
age there was a general weakening of tribal authority and of
clan-law, a break-up of the power of control exercised by
the kindred, the phratry, and the tribe over their members,
in cases of homicide, and in other matters.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Yet when Glotz
comes to discuss the Solonian legislation, we find him still
speaking<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> of an anti-clan policy, of the desire of Solon to
weaken the clans. ‘Solon,’ he says, ‘fut nommé par la
confiance de ses concitoyens arbitre et législateur. Pour
remplir cette double mission, il lui fallut de toute nécessité
affaiblir les γένη dans leur action extérieure et leur constitution
intime.... L’esprit même de la constitution solonienne est
opposé au classement des citoyens par γένη. L’Etat se met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
directement en rapport avec les individus. Les groupes, il
ne les détruit pas, il les ignore.... Effet indirect des lois
constitutionnelles, le démembrement du γένος est le but
immédiat et constant des lois civiles ... cette signature de
Solon, c’est l’hostilité envers les solidarités des vieux temps.’
Again, he says<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that at the beginning of the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
‘At a time when all cities had equally suppressed tribal or
clan responsibility (<i>la responsabilité familiale</i>) in common
law, Athens surpassed all others by the vigour of the blows
which it struck at the internal organisation and the civic
action (<i>l’action sociale</i>) of the clans.’ How can these apparently
different view-points be reconciled? Can we express the
facts so that the apparent discrepancy will disappear?</p>

<p>We have seen that in post-Homeric times the long submerged
group-system of tribal society resumed its sway.
Though the wars and migrations of the period must for a
time have weakened its power, yet ultimately, as Thucydides
says, ‘Hellas recovered tranquillity, and began to send out
colonies.’<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The new doctrine of Apollo, which regarded
homicide as a ‘pollution,’ was, we think, adopted about the
seventh century, which was pre-eminently the period of
Greek colonisation. Henceforth the homicide was conceived
as an enemy not merely of the ghosts of those whom he had
slain but also of the gods of the new States which had evolved
out of chaos through synoekism. But Attica, almost alone
of all Greek States, was immune from the chaos of migrations
and invasions and retained for the most part its original
inhabitants. Therefore Attica, more than any other Greek
State, required, for its political unification, a more strenuous
law-making, a more violent attack on the civic action of
the clan.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot suppose that the clans and tribes of the
group-system were destroyed in Attica any more than they
were in other parts of Greece. All through the historical era
clans and tribes continued to exercise limited powers and
jurisdictions; the old ties of kindred and of neighbourhood
were maintained under the form of religious corporations
long after the group-system had lost its political power. All
this is merely to say that the old aristocracy of birth was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
replaced by plutocracy and democracy. The various stages
in this transition will be made clear if we give a brief sketch
of the political evolution of Attica, a sketch which is all the
more necessary because of the analysis which we shall have
to give, at a later stage, of blood-vengeance in Attic tragedy.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Evolution of the Attic State</span></h5>

<p>We need not allow ourselves to be detained by the obscure
and conflicting legends which centre round the birth of the
Attic nation. Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> refers to the traditions concerning
local kings of Attica before the time of Cecrops. Pausanias
refers to a kind of religious amalgamation which was doubtless
the concomitant of political synoekism: ‘Sacred to Athene,’
he says, ‘is all the rest’<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of Athens and similarly all Attica;
although they worship different gods in different townships,
none the less do they honour Athene generally. He
points out that four villages at Marathon were still in his
time united in a local worship of Apollo, and that legend
attributed to Cecrops a federation of Attica into twelve
different states.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> While Coulanges accepts the legend which
attributes to Theseus the political unification of Attica, he
thinks<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> that Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are in error in
supposing that Theseus abolished the local prytanies and
magistracies. ‘If he attempted this,’ he says, ‘he certainly
did not succeed; for a long while after him we still find the
local worships, the assemblies, and the kings of the tribes.’</p>

<p>In theory the four tribes of ancient Attic society were
Ionian tribes which, in the days of oligarchic power, imposed
their will upon the rest of Attica. Müller<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> points out that
there is a distinct change in Attic mythology when we come
to the Ionian Kings, Aegeus and Theseus. But Leaf thinks
it possible that the adoption of the four Ionian tribes in Attica
does not represent an Ionian conquest, but was due to the
fictitious self-inclusion of Attica in the Ionian race.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Bury
holds<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> that ‘the statesmen who united Attica sought their
method of organisation from one of those cities of Asia Minor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
which Athens came to look upon as her own daughters’:
that the names of the four Attic tribes,<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Geleontes, Aigikoreis,
Argadeis and Hopletes, were borrowed from Ionian Miletus:
and that Attica was united into a single state in the period
of what is known as the life-regency (1088 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-753 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p>The tribal continuity of Attic life is most clearly indicated
in the excellent analysis of F. de Coulanges. The people
of Attica, at the birth of the Attic State, were governed, he
says,<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> by noble clans called Eupatridae who had abolished,
about 1050 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the power of an hereditary monarchy. Some
three hundred years later, these same noble clans limited the
power of the life-regent (a member of the royal family) by
insisting on an election being held every ten years. About
700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> annual election was in force, and the royal family
was represented by only one member in a government of
nine archons elected from the Eupatrid caste. These
Eupatridae, who dwelt in scattered groups in Attica,<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> created
a united Attic State when they formed a confederation for
the purpose of defence and common worship. But the absence
of sustained danger from abroad and the development of
mutual rivalry and internal feuds diminished, at length,
their pristine vigour.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Non-privileged classes, herded together
in towns and hamlets, saw in Eupatrid weakness their own
opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The introduction of coinage in the seventh
century and the expansion of trade and commerce led to the
presence, in Attic ports and cities, of a new nobility of wealthy
merchants who could not<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> aspire to enrolment in the exclusive
Eupatrid tribes, who could not be permitted to worship at the
altars of tribal gods, who were not, in fact, recognised as a
functional element of the civic organism. Naturally, these
merchants imported new worships; they seized on Oriental
cults which, like Buddhism, excluded no caste. Conscious of
the barriers which confronted them, they often had recourse
to armed revolt.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The conflict ended at length upon the
appointment of a legislator who was expected to revise and
to codify the laws. Dracon, the first great Athenian legislator,
certainly codified the laws, or some of them at least. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
being too loyal a Eupatrid, he failed to remove the grievances
of plebeian <i>nobiles</i>. Solon, a Eupatrid by birth, had the
advantage of being a merchant by occupation.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> He first
attacked the large domains of the Eupatrids and their political
power.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> He assailed their monopoly of judicial authority<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
by setting up a timocratic, if not a plutocratic, Areopagus,
as an alternative to the aristocratic Ephetae courts, and by
the institution of popularly elected Heliastic juries which
possessed at first, appellant, and later, universal jurisdiction
in Attic law. But it was only in the time of Cleisthenes,
about 510 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that the four patriarchal tribes of Attica were
removed from the pedestal on which they had stood so long
and which was the basis of their political existence. Ten
new tribes were created, on an entirely novel principle of
local segregation: new hero-cults arose: new priests offered
sacrifice, who were liable to annual election: and the four
Ionian tribes ceased to have any political meaning.</p>

<p>But they did not, therefore, cease to exist.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Obscure
and hidden, they still lived on. Clan-courts still sat to decide
disputes regarding property, adoption, and inheritance.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
In the time of Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> such courts imposed fines
for the embezzlement of property. Homicide, in particular,
which from the eighth century onwards assumed a ‘religious,’
which is to say, a theocratic or patriarchal aspect, was in
historical times ‘purged’ and in certain cases ‘judged’ by
the Ephetae and the Exegetae who were chosen<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> from Eupatrid
families.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to consider the advent in Greece
of that new religious doctrine which for the first time declared
the murderer to be a sinner against the gods and debarred
him for ever from his country and his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section II</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Religious and Legal Transitions</span></h5>

<p>The evidence of mythology and archaeology points so clearly
to frequent and continuous intercourse between the early
Greeks and their non-Aryan neighbours of Egypt and Asia
Minor that up to quite recent years it was possible to maintain
that early Greek civilisation was derived from African and
Asiatic sources. Thus—to quote a writer easily accessible—Mahaffy<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
held that to the Phoenicians and to the Egyptians
is to be traced ‘the prehistoric culture of Argos, Mycenae,
Orchomenus and Crete.’ There are, he thought,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Oriental,
Assyrian and Syrian influences in Mycenaean remains. Egypt,
especially, was regarded as the home of wealth and culture.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
It is only in more recent years when the explorations in Crete
have shown, for example, that ‘compared with the palace
of Cnossus, the palaces of the Pharaohs were but hovels of
painted mud,’<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that the early Aegean culture came to be
regarded as derived from an indigenous Cretan civilisation,
and Minoans received the honour which was previously
accorded to the Phoenicians. It is now recognised that the
great period of Asiatic intercourse with Greece was the post-Minoan
period. The fall of the Minoan thalassocracy opened
the Aegean Sea to Asiatic traders. ‘The Phoenicians,’ says
Bury,<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> ‘had marts here and there on coast or island, but there
is no reason to think that Canaanites made homes for themselves
on Greek soil.... Their ships were ever winding in and out
of the Aegean isles from north to south, bearing fair naperies
from Syria, fine wrought bowls and cups from the workshops of
Sidonian and Cypriot silversmiths, and all manner of luxuries
and ornaments: this constant commercial intercourse ...
is amply sufficient to account for all the influence that
Phoenicia exerted upon Greece.... The briskest trade was
perhaps driven with the thriving cities of Ionia, and the
Phoenicians adopted the Ionian name ... as the general
designation of all the Greeks.’ In Ionia, Bury thinks,<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> occurred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
that fusion of Semitic consonants with Greek vowel symbols
which produced the Greek alphabet. In close contact with
the Ionian Greeks were the Lydians, who were the first people
to coin money (about 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>) and who transmitted the
discovery to the Greeks and to other Asiatic peoples. Needless
to say, this discovery was of great commercial importance,
and incidentally rendered possible an accumulation of non-landed
wealth. Now Greek coinage, as Bury points out,<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
‘was marked from the beginning by religious associations,
and it has been supposed that the priests of the temples had
an important share in initiating the introduction of coinage.
It was in the shrines of their gods that men were accustomed
to store their treasures for safe-keeping.... Every coin
which a Greek State issued bore upon it a reference to some
deity.’</p>

<p>From these facts alone, apart from general considerations,
it will be evident how easy and natural it was that the Greeks
should also have received religious inspirations from their
Asiatic neighbours.</p>

<p>It is very significant that the first mention, in Greek literature,
of the religious purgation of homicide occurs in an epic
poem, the <i>Aethiopis</i>, by Arctinus of Miletus,<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> who lived in
the last half of the eighth century (750-700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). In this poem
we are told that Achilles, having slain Thersites because he had
ridiculed his tears for the death of an Amazonian queen, went
to Lesbos to be purified. Glotz points out that the presence
of Achilles at a sacrifice before his purgation implies that the
doctrine was not, at that time, fully developed or understood.</p>

<p>Again, it is very significant that Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> attributes to
the Lydians rites of homicide-purgation which, he says, are
almost the same as those which the Hellenes used. According
to the historian, there came to Croesus, King of Lydia, about
the year 550 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, ‘a man, in wretched plight, whose hands
were not clean, a Phrygian by race, of royal blood.’ ‘Having
reached,’ he says, ‘the house of Croesus, this man asked to
have himself purified according to the customs of the place, and
Croesus purified him.’ After the ceremony Croesus asked his
visitor who it was that he had slain: the stranger replied that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
he had involuntarily slain his brother and that, in consequence,
he had been expelled by his father and deprived of all his
privileges. We shall see presently<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> that involuntary kin-slaying
could be purged abroad, in the Greek purgation-system.
We cannot conclude, because Croesus made no
inquiries prior to the ceremony as to the details of the deed
of blood, that therefore all kinds of homicide could be purged
amongst the Lydians. The very fact that the slayer requested
purgation would, in the religious atmosphere of the time, have
been taken as sufficient evidence that his deed was at least
capable of being purged.</p>

<p>The conception of homicide as a pollution or religious offence
is known to have existed at an early date amongst the Hebrews,
and we may hazard the conjecture, though we find no express
reference to the fact, that a system of purgation was practised
by the Hebrews, at least for minor degrees of guilt. The
penalties exacted for homicide amongst the Hebrews, as
amongst the Romans, were much more severe than those which
prevailed amongst the Greeks. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that in the
normal operation of homicide-purgation no religious ‘cleansing’
was valid while the civic penalty remained unpaid. In Roman
law, death was the penalty prescribed for murder and for manslaughter:
but for justifiable or justifiably accidental homicide<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
there was no punishment, and religious expiation could
immediately take place. Amongst the Hebrews, a similar
penalty was exacted for murder and manslaughter. ‘Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed’ is the
general principle<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; and again: ‘He that smiteth a man so
that he die<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> shall surely be put to death: if a man slays
presumptuously with guile, take him from my altar that he
may die.’<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> For accidental or justifiable slaying, however, we
find that a mode of escape from the avengers of blood was provided:
‘If God delivers a man into his hands,<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> I will appoint
thee a place whither he shall flee<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> ... and ye shall not take
compensation for him that is fled to the City of Refuge that he
should come home before the death of the high-priest. So ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
shall not pollute the land wherein ye are.’<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> We may assume,
with some degree of probability, that in this class of homicide,
some form of purgation ceremony was customary. We
mention the Hebrew custom here merely to show the general
trend of Asiatic thought in regard to homicide.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, regard as highly probable the view
which connects the origin of the post-Homeric Greek notion of
homicide as a ‘pollution’ with the Semites and Asiatic peoples.
Glotz merely states his view of this matter without giving
reasons in support of his statement.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> ‘Alors,’ he says, ‘les
Grecs prendront aux Sémites les rites dramatiques de leurs
cérémonies purificatoires.’ There were, however, some important
differences between the original Semitic doctrine and the
matured Greek adaptation of it, as will be evident from a brief
explanation of the precise nature of the Greek ‘pollution’
doctrine.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Greek Pollution Doctrine</span></h5>

<p>At first, we think, there came to Greece a vague rumour
of the doctrine through the medium of the Cyclic poets. Greek
priesthoods in Asia had already adopted it because of their
proximity to Asiatic races who had developed it. But originating,
as it did, in the centralised theocracies which then existed
amongst these races, the doctrine could be accepted only in a
modified form by the Greek people whose predominant political
institution was the city-state.</p>

<p>Traces of the doctrine in its early phase, prior to its
formal adoption in Greece, appear in the story of Alcmaeon.
Thucydides,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in his account of the islands known as the
Echinades, in western Greece, which were gradually, owing to
the silting up of the river Achelous, becoming part of the mainland,
mentions the following legend: ‘when Alcmaeon, son of
Amphiaraus, was wandering over the earth after the murder
of his mother, he was told by Apollo that here he should find a
home, the oracle intimating that he would never find deliverance
from his terrors until he discovered some country which
was not yet in existence and not seen by the Sun at the time
when he slew his mother; there he might settle, but the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
the earth was accursed to him. He knew not what to do till
at last, as the story goes, he espied the deposit of earth made by
the Achelous, and he thought that a place sufficient to support
life must have accumulated in the long time during which he
had been wandering since his mother’s death.’ This conception
of pollution is very Semitic, and reminds us of the Biblical
allusion to Cain<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> as ‘cursed from the face of the earth,’ but it
is also to a certain extent Greek, since there was not in historical
Greece any purgation for wilful matricide or, if we may trust
Plato,<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> for wilful kin-slaying. In the Apolline era Greek kin-slaying
was punished, according to Plato,<a id="FNanchor_679b" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> by death, and it was
so punished in a later Israelite penal code. In the Pelasgian
era, kin-slayers, condemned to perpetual exile, were often
compelled to wander for years and years. Their wandering
must have been almost proverbial, yet its meaning was understood.
But the picture of a kin-slayer wandering till he finds
an unpolluted piece of earth can only be attributed to the
fanciful interpretation of a novel religious law which as yet was
not fully comprehended. We have already discussed<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Miss
Harrison’s views in regard to Bellerophon and the ‘plain of
wandering.’ Apollodorus tells us<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> that Bellerophon was
purified by Proetus. Miss Harrison says<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> ‘in those old days
he could not be purified.’ We agree that he could not be purged
in Homeric times, because the rite was unknown: if in later
times he was said to have been purged, it became necessary to
suppose that the crime which he committed was involuntary.
But Homer says nothing of Bellerophon’s kin-slaying.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It
was probably an invention of later minds intended to explain
the Homeric reference to the ‘Aleïan plain’ which was interpreted
as ‘the plain of wandering,’ after the analogy of the
‘wandering’ in the legend of Alcmaeon.</p>

<p>We hope to show presently that this religious doctrine, which
declared in effect that homicide brought down the anger of the
gods upon the community which neglected to punish it, took
definite shape in historical Greece under the aegis of Apollo
and his priesthoods and Amphictyonies. In our view, the final
form of the doctrine was a fusion or compromise between the
severer Semitic conception, on the one hand, and, on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the tribal traditions of Greek homicide-customs, weakened
and disorganised, as they were, in the Hesiodic age of chaos,
but unmistakably local in their outlook, and reflecting still the
attitude adopted by the relatives and attributed to the victim.
The Apollo of the Greek race could not accept in its entirety
the Asiatic doctrine of pollution but had to modify it at the
bidding of customs which were sanctified by time. As we
believe that the Draconian homicide-laws were merely an
eclectic codification of the seventh-century unwritten laws of
the aristocracies of birth, it would clearly anticipate our whole
account of the Draconian legislation if we were to explain at
this stage the detailed operation of the Apolline pollution
system. We shall then give here only an outline of the Asiatic-Greek
compromise which we believe to have arisen in the
eighth or seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the first place wergeld was abolished, as amongst the
Hebrews, for wilful murder. This was the greatest concession
which the new doctrine extorted from tribalism. The new
provision which declared the property of the wilful man-slayer
confiscated to the State when the slayer had gone into perpetual
exile we attribute to a third factor—the evolution of State
power: wergeld in the strict sense was also abolished for
manslaughter, but the slayer was allowed and commanded,
after a period of exile, to ‘appease’ by ‘presents’ the relatives
of the slain. In this we can clearly detect a concession wrung
from what we call Apollinism by the tribes. It is usually held<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
that in the case of manslaughter, and Glotz holds<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> that even
in the case of murder, ‘private settlement’ without trial was
legal in historical Athens. We hope to show<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> at a later stage
that these opinions are incorrect, except in regard to one special
and rare contingency.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a religious compromise which is reflected
in the ritual of purgation. In the Semitic doctrine of pollution,
murder and manslaughter could only be ‘purged’ by the blood
of the slayer, which meant, in practice, that the slayer could
never be purged at all: but the ancient traditions of the tribes
and their capacity for discerning the varying degrees of homicide-guilt
led to a peculiar compromise, by which Apollo and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
other State gods consented to accept the sacrifice of a surrogate
victim, when the atonement which the law prescribed had been
paid, the actuality of the atonement being <i>symbolised</i>, as it were,
by this Chthonian sacrifice of ‘reconciliation.’</p>

<p>Since Greece, unlike Israel, was a conglomeration of local
civic groups, and as tribal custom had accepted exile in default
of wergeld and prescribed different periods of exile according
to varying degrees of guilt, therefore, when the issue was knit
between the new Semitic doctrine of ‘pollution’ and the ancient
tribal laws, the resultant compromise produced a new law
which decreed perpetual exile for all cases of wilful homicide,
including, we believe, originally, even kin-slaying. The law
of historical times which condemned the kin-slayer inevitably
to death was not, we have reason to believe, a product of the
Asiatic-Greek compromise. Like the law which decreed the
confiscation of a murderer’s property, it is, we think, to be
attributed to the evolution of centralised State government.
In regard to manslaughter different periods of exile were, no
doubt, decreed according to the different degrees of guilt: the
despotic doctrine of theocratic Asia had, in this, to respect
the long traditions of tribal Greece: accidental and justifiable
slaying probably required no civic atonement. Apollo was
compelled to admit such slayers to immediate ‘purgation.’ In
other cases, ‘purgation’ was accepted when the prescribed
atonement had been made.</p>

<p>Our account of this compromise in the Greek doctrine of
pollution is complicated by the presence of a third factor which
had become more and more important as Greek States increased
in size and power, and which must be indirectly attributed to the
doctrine of ‘pollution,’ namely, the conception of homicide as
an insult to the State gods and to the State, not merely to the
Sun, or to the Delphian Apollo, or to some still more distant
Orphic deity in the underworld. This conception of homicide
raises it at once from the position which it held in the system of
‘private vengeance’: the murderer, like the traitor and the
man stained with sacrilege, now stands forth, if not as a criminal
in the modern sense, at least as a quasi-criminal, a vile being
who has jeopardised by his act the prosperity and the destiny
of the State. He is henceforth liable to ἄτιμία,—he must be
degraded from citizenship: if he waits for the verdict which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
declares him a State criminal, he must die. If he flees, his
property must be confiscated to the State, as was the property
of all ‘degraded’ exiles. Retribution to the relatives, which is
the basis of tribal wergeld, has vanished into the air, but the
murderer cannot now be buried in the tomb of his fathers: he
can never frequent the temples of his gods: he cannot even
attend the public games of all the Greeks lest the contact of his
presence should pollute his fellow citizens or the gods who no
longer can tolerate his presence. But, provided he avoids
certain areas and festivals, he may live without fear. A law
of Dracon<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> declares that to slay such an exile was murder.
Thus we see how the old tribal custom which accepted exile
as a complete atonement, (not, as it was amongst Achaean
militarists, a mere flight from death,) was respected despite
doctrinal innovations, because it had been sanctified by time.</p>

<p>Glotz holds<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that this immunity in foreign states of exiles
who were guilty of wilful murder in their home-land was due to
occasional treaties of ἀσυλία between Greek States. We shall
see that such immunity was more probably derived from Greek
extradition law, and such law implies international authorisation.
It was precisely because such laws could be made and
enforced that Greek homicides required no ‘cities of Refuge.’
Thus, the Greek pollution-doctrine bears on the face of it the
stamp of a compromise between tribe and State, between local
gods and international religion.</p>

<p>But there was a further compromise, which we must also
indicate, namely, that which inevitably took place between the
ghosts of the slain and the purifying gods, the καθάρσιοι θεοί.
We have argued<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that the chaotic centuries which followed the
Achaean domination produced a much more monstrous and
bloodthirsty conception of the Erinnyes than that which
existed in the Homeric age. We have suggested that the
revolt of the clansmen against Apolline innovations which
abolished material retribution for homicide may have rendered
still more ferocious and implacable the Erinnyes of the slain.
Yet when the Greek Apolline doctrine of pollution was finally
accepted by Hellenic tribes and States, the Erinnyes, like the
Titans, were subdued, and became so mild that they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
be identified with the Semnai Theai and called Eumenides!
They could live in peace again, as in Homer, with the Olympian
gods whom they had learned to loathe.</p>

<p>They had succeeded at least in imposing many old Pelasgian
traditions upon the autocrat of Delphi. In historical Greece,
at least before the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the State could never
take the initiative in a direct prosecution for homicide, as modern
States do. It could, of course, bring a charge of Impiety
against delinquent relatives of the slain<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>: but the initiative
rested in theory with those relatives. The wish of a dying man
who had been fatally wounded was expressed in a formal
‘charge’ which he gave to his relatives, and this very often
determined the course of subsequent proceedings. ‘Forgiveness’
by the dying man precluded a charge of murder. If a
Greek of the historical era, who had been fatally wounded,
thus ‘released’ his slayer before he died, the relatives were not
bound to prosecute<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>: they could be persuaded to refrain from
prosecution by what is known as a ‘private settlement’ with
the slayer and his relatives. This, of course, was not a genuine
wergeld; and even if it was, we could not infer that pollution
could coexist with wergeld, for ‘pollution’ did not arise, in
any real sense of the word, as the Greeks interpreted it, when
the dying man forgave. Now we cannot conceive such considerations
as these affecting the theocratic ‘pollution’ doctrine
of the Hebrews. The law which decreed by divine command
that: ‘Ye shall not pollute my land wherein ye are: for blood
defileth the land,’ takes little account of the wishes of the dying
or of the relatives of the slain. We must, of course, distinguish
‘release’ from ‘forgiveness’ in Greek law. ‘Release’ implies
the absence of any ‘charge’ by the dying man. In cases of
involuntary homicide, unless the dying man commanded his
relatives to prosecute, no trial or formal proceedings were
necessary<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>: ‘private settlement’ was permitted. Whenever
therefore a trial for involuntary homicide took place in historical
Greece, we must assume either that the accused denied
the guilt and refused ‘private’ compensation or that the dying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
man charged his relatives to prosecute. In this latter case the
slayer was polluted and had to undergo purgation when the
civic atonement had been made. Hence we may truly say that,
within certain limitations, Greek ‘pollution’ depended on the
will of the victim and of his relatives.</p>

<p>In the light of these details we can more easily explain
the peculiar fact that a man who had no relatives—and it
was sometimes possible that a metic, or a stranger, or a casual
vagrant should have no relatives—could not be avenged if
he were slain. In the <i>Euthyphro</i> of Plato<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> we are told how
a poor freeman who had killed a slave was put in chains by his
employer—it was a kind of informal arrest—till the verdict
of the Exegetae should be heard. The freeman died. It was
not wilful murder, but there was a certain degree of guilt,
a certain amount of neglect on the part of his captor, a certain
ἀφυλαξία which laid the employer open to a charge of manslaughter.
Euthyphro, a son of the employer, feeling that he
was ‘polluted’ by the fact of living with his father, proposed
to charge him before the Archon Basileus at Athens; Socrates
asks Euthyphro in the dialogue if he was a relative of the
slain. Euthyphro replies that he does not see what difference
it makes whether one is a relative of the deceased or not; the
important thing is that he is polluted unless he accuses his
father. Socrates implies that such an accusation is impious.
We can only regret that Plato does not tell us the sequel of
this fanciful drama. We think that Plato is sophistically
exposing, if not covertly sneering at, the inconsistency<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> of
the pollution doctrine. He objects, apparently, to the law
which made prosecution the prerogative of the relatives of the
deceased, a law which was derived, we think, from tribal
traditions of ‘private vengeance,’ just as in other passages
he objects to the legends of the gods which more primitive
generations had created.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>We have said that ‘pollution’ was not confined to the
murderer, but extended, as if by contagion, to all persons who
harboured or protected him or neglected to punish him. Thus
Plato says,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in regard to kin-slaying: ‘The relative of
deceased as far as cousins, male and female, who does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
prosecute ... shall take upon himself the pollution and the
anger of the gods.’ In this we see an aspect of the Greek
‘pollution’ doctrine which expressed the autocratic will of
Delphi and of State-gods in alliance with Delphi. But if the
dying man ‘forgave’ or, in certain cases, did not solemnly
‘charge’ his relatives to prosecute, this autocratic will could
be ignored. Thus, the Erinnys of a slain man had a determining
effect on the obligation of prosecution and on the
nature of the penalty. In the Oresteian legends as they were
staged by Attic dramatists, this twofold aspect of ‘pollution’
is never quite forgotten; but there are complications in these
legends which prevent us from dwelling at any length upon
them here.</p>

<p>In the case of kin-slaying in a ‘passion,’ the influence of
the ghosts’ will was especially vigorous. Plato says<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that
even when the ‘involuntary’ slayer had served a term of
three years’ exile, and had returned to his native land, he could
never return to his family and his home, or share with his
kindred in domestic rites. Thus the Erinnys of the slain
kinsman refused to be controlled by a centralised autocracy
at Delphi, or even by the will of native State-gods. Hence,
perhaps, it is that in the dramatised versions of the Oresteia,
Athene has to use ‘Persuasion’<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> to induce the Furies of
Clytaemnestra to become Eumenides. Hence the Furies say
of Orestes<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Ritual of Homicide-Purgation</span></h5>

<p>In regard to the ceremonial of purgation by which the
slayer, in certain circumstances, was ‘cleansed’ or purified,
we have already<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> pointed out what we consider to have been
the origin of the rite; and we have shown how the analogies
which existed between such a ceremonial and the general
Chthonian sacrifices of ‘expiation,’ ‘placation,’ and ‘aversion’
caused these rites to be confused with one another in the
minds of ancient and of modern writers. The ceremonial of
homicide-purgation appears at first sight so simple and
elementary in character that we would be inclined to assume
<i>a priori</i> that it could have been duly performed by any ordinary
person. But, in fact, we shall see, the performance became
the privilege of priests or theocratic nobles. An animal,
generally a pig,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> but sometimes a calf or a lamb,<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> was bled
to death and the warm flowing blood was poured over the
hands of the slayer, passing away into the sea or into a
running stream. The dead animal was then thrown into the
water, or was buried, but it could not be eaten.</p>

<p>We may compare the Chthonian ceremony of swearing,
in which the slain animal was conceived as at once symbolising
and magically inducing a similar fate in case of perjury. The
Roman formula is well known. Livy tells<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> how a certain
M. Valerius, one of the Fetiales, or Roman priests, swore on
behalf of the Roman State, to the Almighty Juppiter, in a
treaty with ancient Alba. ‘Audi, Iuppiter: audi, pater
patrate populi Albani: audi tu, populus Albanus ... si prior
defexit publico consilio, dolo malo, tu illo die, Iuppiter, populum
Romanum sic ferito ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam:
tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes pollesque.’ Now,
all such ceremonies, simple as they may appear, were hedged
round with the most minute regulations as to formulae and
procedure, and were thus removed from the competence of
ordinary individuals.</p>

<p>Moreover, each locality developed differences of usage
which, however slight, could never be ignored. Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
speaking of homicide purgation, implies that all Greeks used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
the same rites. But that there were minor local variations
may be inferred, perhaps, from a peculiar ceremony in the
<i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> of Sophocles. Oedipus, having gone as an
exile from Thebes to Attica because he had slain his father,
is told<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> that he cannot hold converse with the Athenians
while he is still uncleansed. The ban is removed when he is
admitted to ‘purgation,’ but for the due performance of the
rite he is entirely dependent on local direction. We shall give
the relevant dialogue between Oedipus and the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>:</p>

<p>It may be said that we have not here a genuine instance
of homicide-purgation. There is no animal sacrifice, no
‘cleansing’ by a bath of blood. Water and honey were
regular offerings to the dead, and the express prohibition of
wine-libations reminds us very forcibly of the sacrifice to
the Erinnyes made by Clytaemnestra in the <i>Eumenides</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Has Sophocles in mind, then, a local rite of
placation to the Erinnys of Oedipus at Colonus, which he
interprets as a commemoration of purgation rites? We have
seen how easily such rites may be confused. Or are we to
assume that the purgation rite for involuntary or extenuated
homicide was different from the rites by which a wilful murderer
could be purged ‘abroad’ or from those by which a justifiable
slayer was purged at home? Was the sacrifice which was
offered to the Erinnyes or the Semnai Theai<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> by involuntary
slayers after their return from exile, and by accused persons
who were acquitted by the Areopagus, a regular purgation
rite? These questions we find it difficult to answer either in
the affirmative or in the negative. Plato’s references<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> to
greater and lesser ‘cleansings’ according to different degrees
of guilt imply that the average Greek did not understand the
exact nature or purpose of ‘purgation’ and that the secrets
of this magic art of reconciliation were the exclusive privilege
of theocratic nobles whose interest it was to obscure rather
than to clarify the details of the system. The passage we have
quoted from the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> possibly points to variations
in the ‘purgation’ ritual according to degrees of guilt—variations
which suggest moreover the ambition and the
power of local deities and priesthoods to retain their distinctive
peculiarities in the execution of a central Apolline
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Iphigenia Taurica</i> of Euripides<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> we find a mock
purgation ceremony arranged by Iphigeneia to save the lives
of Orestes and of Pylades. The image of Artemis is said
(it was a fiction invented by a loving sister) to have turned
in its seat and to have closed its eyes when the blood-stained
Argive cousins entered the temple! Iphigeneia proposes to
‘cleanse’ the pollution by the blood of young lambs shed in
solitude by the sea and such other things as she has ordered
as purifications. King Thoas, not being himself appealed to,
leaves the whole question of purgation entirely in the hands
of the priestess of Artemis.</p>

<p>From the legend that Bellerophon was cleansed by his
host Proetus,<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the king of Tiryns, we might be inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
argue that the purgation rites for certain forms of kin-slaying
were performed by private non-sacerdotal individuals. But
every king was a High Priest in primitive religion; and,
further, we have already seen that Proetus could not have
performed the post-Homeric ceremony which is attributed to
him. It is however possible that Croesus personally ‘purged’
the Phrygian homicide mentioned by Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that in Greece the ‘cleansers’ of homicide-guilt
were always ‘priests’ of some kind. Epimenides of Crete
purged the city of Athens on a famous occasion, yet not from
murder but rather from sacrilege<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>; moreover, Müller points
out<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that he was a native of Phaestus in Crete where there
was a very ancient cult of Apollo; hence Epimenides was more
than probably a member of an Apolline sacerdotal guild.
Müller is, however, we think mistaken in regarding purgation for
homicide as the exclusive privilege of Apolline priests. The
Euripidean reference to purgation by a priestess of Artemis
which we have just cited,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Athene’s interpretation<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of the
supplication of Orestes as a supplication for purgation, in the
<i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus, and many passages in the <i>Laws</i> of
Plato,<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> reveal the error of this opinion.</p>

<p>The purgation of Orestes by Apollo is described by Aeschylus
in the <i>Eumenides</i>. It is no priest or priestess of Olympian or
Chthonian gods, but Apollo himself,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the chief of the καθάρσιοι
θεοί, who performs the rite. We cannot interpret the ceremony
as the purgation of a wilful matricide ‘abroad,’ as we think
that such purgation was impossible, at least in historical
times.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> It is the ‘purging’ rather of a deed which is either
justified or extenuated by Apollo’s express command, a
‘purging’ which would normally take place in the slayer’s
home-land but which is here attributed to a divine Delphian
purifier either because Apollo was the patron of the Greek
‘purgation’ system or because the deed was such that no one
could have cleansed it save the god who had commanded it,
or because a Phocian legend made Phocis, not Athens, the place
to which Orestes fled after the slaying of his mother. Orestes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
tells<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Athene that he is not a suppliant for purgation at
Athens, because he has been already ‘purged.’ We may
infer from this that a homicide-exile had not to be ‘purged’
more than once in his changes of residence abroad, but we
think it probable that such ‘extern’ purgation did not dispense
with the need for ‘domestic’ purgation if the exile was ever
permitted to return to his home.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Orestes says<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>: ‘There
is a law that the shedder of blood is debarred from human
intercourse until at the hands of a man who purifies from
bloodshed the blood of a young animal has been poured upon
him. Long ago have I been thus made clean by others who
live elsewhere, by animal victims beside running water.’</p>

<p>From this passage, and from the reference which we have
cited from Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia Taurica</i>, as well as from more
general considerations we conclude that homicide-purgation
normally included the shedding of animal blood when some
element of guilt was admitted. It is possible, therefore, that
the rite described by Sophocles, in the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
was not conceived as a genuine purgation-rite but rather as
an exceptional local procedure which was intended to supplement
a presumed anterior purgation.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> That Attica was
noteworthy for its scruples regarding ‘pollution’ may be
inferred from the remarks of the Corinthian Chorus in the
<i>Medea</i> of Euripides.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>We are entirely on the side of Müller<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and Philippi<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> in
the view that purgation, in historical Greece, was applied to
the authors of justifiable bloodshed.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> This we may regard
as a further confirmation of our opinion that homicide-purgation
was not a placation of ghosts or an expiation offered
to gods, but a solemn and sacred symbol of reconciliation
between the slayer and his native gods.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Our hypothesis of the origin of the Greek doctrine of
homicide as a pollution will receive still further confirmation
when we describe in more detail the historical Greek system
of penalties for bloodshed and the conceptions of those penalties
which are found in Attic tragedy. We will now give the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
reasons which have led us to associate the Greek ‘pollution’
doctrine with the Delphian Apollo and his Amphictyonic
League, after which we shall be in a position to discuss<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
the influence of the ‘pollution’ doctrine on ‘wergeld’ and
the legality of ‘private settlement.’ The following account
is intended as a supplement to Müller’s analysis, which errs
only in attributing purgation-rites exclusively to Apollo and
his priests.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Apollo and Pollution</span></h5>

<p>In Homer, Apollo has already established at Pytho a temple
of many treasures.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The reference to ‘sacred Crisa’ side by
side with ‘rocky Pytho’<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> suggests, if the Greeks were right
in their interpretation of ‘Crisa’ as ‘the Cretan land,’ that the
region was already revered in the days of the Minoan thalassocracy.
Aeschylus in the <i>Eumenides</i><a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> reproduces the Greek
tradition regarding oracle-deities at Delphi, before the advent
of Apollo. The Delphian priestess accords priority to Ge, the
Earth-goddess, ‘the first of prophets,’ and then she prays to
Themis, as the second deity who gave oracles there. This
legend probably originated in a joint worship of Ge and of
Themis under the forms of the Mother and the Maid; for,
just as the cult of Demeter and Kore represented the joint
worship of the Earth and its produce, so the cult of Ge and
Themis represented the worship of the Earth and of the
deified uniformity of the Earth’s fertility. Next the priestess
prays to Phoebe, another daughter of Earth, who in turn
transmitted the oracle to her son, Phoebus Apollo. It was
supposed that the temple which is mentioned by Homer was
the fourth<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> temple which had been built on that site. This
temple was destroyed in 548 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, according to Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Hence it is much less probable that the oracular shrine had been
handed down by continuous succession as an inheritance
within a ‘divine family’ than that it was repeatedly destroyed
and desecrated by successive invaders. The destruction of
Crisa in 585 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> by the Amphictyonic League furnishes an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
historical illustration of its chequered career in prehistoric
ages. The octennial festival known as the Stepteria,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> which
commemorated the conquest of the Python by Apollo, had
probably an historical foundation. For the Python, a large
snake, was worshipped as a symbol of the Earth’s fertility:
it was therefore associated with Ge and Themis, who ‘handed
down’ the oracle according to legend. The famous Omphalos
at Delphi, of which the origin and significance were so
mysterious to the Greeks, was really the tombstone of the
Python. But Earth, though buried, still lived in the tomb!
It was from a cavern of Earth that the Pythian priestess
received the vapours which produced her ‘anaesthetic revelation.’<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
In the Apolline shrine was the Hestia, or sacred
Hearth, derived from pre-Olympian ancestor worship and
necromantic art. Before the pilgrim entered the shrine of
the Olympian oracle, he had to perform a Chthonian sacrifice,
and offer a πέλανος, a mixture of milk, wine and honey, which
was a characteristic offering at the tombs of the dead.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
Around the tomb of the Python stood Gorgon-images,<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> which
were probably suggested by ‘image-magic’ as a placation of
the wrath of the Erinnyes, who sought the life of the slayer
of the Python. It was from these images, we think, that
Aeschylus derived his conception of the Erinnyes, and the
famous scene<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> which depicts them as sleeping a loathsome
sleep in the temple of Apollo, whom they hate but also fear.
We find in Aelian and Plutarch the legend<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> that Apollo, in
the days of his conquest of Delphi, fled to Tempe, after slaying
the Python, to be purified from the pollution. The Stepteria
festival was believed to commemorate his flight! In this
legend, however, as in that in which Zeus purifies Ixion,<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> we
see the effect of aetiological myth-making and the operation of
a principle of primitive religion whereby man makes the gods
in his own image and attributes to them the emotions and
the observances of his own day.</p>

<p>As we cannot regard Apollo, notwithstanding Müller’s<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
reasoning, as the special product of Dorian religion, so we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
cannot attribute his exaltation in post-Homeric days exclusively
to the Dorian invasion. The Achaeans worshipped
Apollo as a prophet-god and as a powerful ally in war, but
their hegemony in Greece was based on military control rather
than on theocratic manipulation. The Delphians are not
mentioned in Homer. They were a Dorian dominant caste
which conquered the Phocian masters of the ‘Homeric’
temple at Pytho,<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> about 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Undoubtedly they could
not have retained the fruits of their conquest for any period
of time, if they had not been supported by the power of the
Dorian invaders of Southern Greece. Thus, in 448 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when
the Phocians had reoccupied Delphi, it was the Dorian Spartans
who sent an army to restore it to the Delphians.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Yet the
Athenians, who were then supreme in Central Greece, restored
it to the Phocians for a time. But, about 585 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when
anti-Dorism was at its height in Greece, it was to a northern
league of Greek States, in which the Dorians were subordinate,
that Delphi looked for help against the Phocians of Crisa.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
The fact that Cleisthenes of Sicyon, an anti-Dorian, championed
the Delphians in this campaign, proves that their Dorian
nationality was already subordinated to the prestige which
they had won as the High Priests of Greek prophetic
religion: and the loan of fifteen talents which a Spartan
king gave to the Phocian general who had once more
seized Delphi in 356 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> shows how Dorism had lost its
primal solidarity.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>We think, then, that the prestige of the Delphian Apollo,
though originating in the Dorian migration, was due to a
combination of two forces: (1) the widespread cult of Apollo
in Greece and in Asia Minor: and (2) the skill by which the
Delphians (who controlled the oracular decrees) impressed the
Greeks and foreign peoples with the unrivalled divinity of
their local shrine in matters of prophecy and healing-magic;
and organised under their banner the local priesthoods of
Greece by annual processions and pilgrimages, by the construction
of sacred roads, and the establishment of religious
Amphictyonies.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> While other ‘sacerdotal’ nobles in Greece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
worshipped a number of deities, Olympian and Chthonian,
the Delphians seem to have concentrated on Apollo. They
were definitely theocratic—being a select caste of nobles,
whose High Priests were elected by lot.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> They formed a
criminal court which exacted the death penalty for sacrilege.
It follows that when homicide became a religious offence,
these judges would not only have decided all cases within
their territory,<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> distinguished between different degrees of
guilt, and pronounced upon the possibility of purgation,
but they would also have used the prestige of the oracle to
make their decisions imitated elsewhere. Thus, the Attic
Eupatridae, who worshipped Apollo Patroos, and their judges,
the Ephetae, who swore by him before their trials,<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> would
naturally have adopted the decisions of the central Apolline
oracle. Moreover, the annual processions of representatives
(θεωροί) of Greek states to Delphi, the Pythian Games, a
festival in which all Greeks participated, and the formation
of religious international leagues or Amphictyonies made
obedience to Apolline oracles almost a matter of obligation.</p>

<p>The great Thessalian Amphictyony of Demeter at Anthela,
a very ancient association, including Thessalians, Locrians,
Phocians, Boeotians, Athenians, Dorian and minor states,
came in the sixth century<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> to meet also at Delphi, and
the temple was placed under the control of international
Hieromnemones who met twice a year and promulgated laws
to be obeyed by all its members, called Amphictyonic laws.
It is significant that, in historical Athens, murder exiles were
prohibited from Amphictyonic festivals.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> This law was
clearly of Amphictyonic origin.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>We have quoted Thucydides’<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> account of the command
which was issued by the oracle of Apollo to Alcmaeon, the
matricide, directing him to travel to the Echinades Islands.
This legend bears, on the face of it, an antique stamp, and the
function which is here ascribed to the Delphic oracle is a first-rate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
piece of evidence for the connexion of Apollo with the
historical doctrine of ‘pollution.’</p>

<p>We have quoted Herodotus’<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> account of the story concerning
Phrixus and Athamas, in which a Delphic oracle was
said to have commanded the Thessalians to ‘purge’ their
country by slaying Athamas in sacrifice. This legend we regard
as ‘unhistorical’ and pseudo-aetiological, but the rôle which
it assigns to Delphi may be cited in support of our present
hypothesis.</p>

<p>In historical Attica, the rites of homicide-purgation were
performed by three persons called Exegetae or Interpreters
who, Suidas<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> assures us, were appointed or controlled by
Delphi (Πυθόχρηστοι). Plato,<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> speaking of the appointment
of Sacred Interpreters, says: ‘It is right to bring from
Delphi the laws relating to all “divine matters” and to follow
these laws, having appointed interpreters for them.’ Speaking
of their appointment he says that from the names of
candidates which stood first on the list after election, nine
should be sent to Delphi, and ‘the god’ was to select
three of these names. The homicide laws of Dracon, as we
shall see later, were not a complete code of homicide-law.
Many details were omitted, and these details, we believe, were
worked out in the unwritten code of the Ephetae and the
Exegetae. In the <i>Euthyphro</i><a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> of Plato, a poor freeman
who had killed a slave was put in chains and cast into a trench
on the wayside to await the decision of the Exegetae concerning
his guilt! The man died from hunger and neglect before
the decision arrived, and the question of avenging his death
forms one of the problems of the dialogue.</p>

<p>Coulanges points out<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> that the Spartans regarded, not
Lycurgus, but Apollo, as the author of their laws. These
laws were Πυθόχρηστοι. If they operated, concerning homicide,
in a comparatively severe manner, this was because the
Spartan military system absorbed without much modification
the autocratic tendencies of Delphic law, but we must
not attach too much importance to a single statement of
Xenophon’s which can perhaps be otherwise explained.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Solon, the Athenian legislator, abolished all the laws of
Dracon except those which related to homicide.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> These
particular laws were themselves an anomaly in the Draconian
code. Plutarch says that the laws of Dracon were said to have
been written with blood, not with ink.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Death was the
penalty for minor thefts, yet the wilful murderer was accorded
the option of exile, and the involuntary slayer, the further
option of ‘appeasing’ the relatives of the slain! The life of
a murderer in exile was ‘protected’ by the decree of a State
whose jurisdiction ceased at its boundaries! We believe that
the Draconian homicide-laws are an eclectic codification of
existing traditions and that these traditions were a compromise
between tribal customs and the seventh-century
Apolline doctrine of ‘pollution.’ Coulanges says<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> that Solon
did not change the murder laws of Dracon, because they were
‘divine,’ and to disobey or tamper with such laws was regarded
as sacrilegious. In our view Apollo and the Delphic oracle
constituted one of the sources, and clan-traditions another,
from which sprang the laws which Dracon codified.</p>

<p>Plato,<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> speaking of the penalties for wilful kin-slaying,
refers to a myth or legend ‘clearly told by priests of old’ to
the effect that Justice, the avenger of kindred bloodshed, has
ordained that the perpetrator of such an act shall suffer the
same doom as he has himself inflicted.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> We have seen<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> that
in the clan-system, kin-slaying was normally punished by
perpetual exile, but not by death. We do not agree with
Caillemer<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> that the fate of such exiles was more pitiable than
that of ordinary homicide exiles, but we support the following
opinion of his in regard to the attitude of the kindred. ‘Ils
hésitent,’ he says, ‘souvent à verser le sang de leur parent:
ils se bornent au bannissement du coupable.’ In Plato,<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
the penalty for kin-slaying is inexorably death. It was, we
believe, the pollution doctrine which indirectly produced this
change, through the abolition of ‘private vengeance.’<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> It
could not have <i>directly</i> produced it, as is clear from the fact
that amongst the Israelites, who still retained the avenger of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
blood, Cain, the murderer of his brother, was punished only
by exile; but when, as in Greece, the pollution-doctrine caused
the State to interfere in the trial of homicide and in the execution
of its penalties, State judges came to execute a penalty
which the relatives of the slain would never have inflicted upon
a kinsman in the days of ‘private vengeance.’ We shall discuss
more fully, later,<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the problems concerning parricide in
Attic law. The fact that parricide was not expressly mentioned
in Dracon’s laws does not prove that such a crime was not
punished by State officials in historical times. Thus the myth
which is attributed by Plato to ‘priests of old’ may be regarded
as another proof of the ‘divine,’ which is to say, the Apolline
inspiration of historical Greek homicide law.</p>

<p>Again,<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> in regard to suicide, Plato says that it is necessary
for the relatives of the deceased to inquire of the ‘Interpreters’
as to the proper methods of purification and of burial.</p>

<p>But the most decisive argument to be derived from Plato
as to the connexion of Apollo with purgation and with Greek
homicide law can be found in the scholium to a passage in the
<i>Laws</i>, a scholium which incidentally supplies a proof of the
historicity of Plato’s murder laws. The passage enunciates
different cases of justifiable homicide, or rather justifiably
accidental homicide—the essence of such discrimination lies in
the fact that certain kinds of accidental slaying were foreseen
and provided for, in advance, whether by custom, or by public
opinion, or by written codes—and the cases which are here
enunciated are identical with those of the Draconian law
regarding justifiable bloodshed.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> We cite only a section of
the passage,<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> which is sufficient for our present purpose.
‘If any person unintentionally slays a fellow-citizen (φίλος) in
a “contest” or at the public games ... or during war, or
in military exercises ... in imitation of warfare ... let
him be purified according to the law brought from Delphi about
such matters and be immune from punishment (καθαρός).’
The scholiast gives the Delphic law, as follows.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> ‘<i>The law or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
oracle</i> brought from Delphi regarding a man who kills his friend
(<i>i.e.</i> fellow-citizen, as distinct from public enemy) involuntarily:—“Thou
hast slain thy comrade (ἑταῖρον) while
intending to defend him (ἀμύνων)—his blood doth not
pollute thee: thou art purer than thou wast before: but thou,
man, who standing near a comrade being killed hast not defended
him—thou hast gone not pure away.”’ That such
important cases of justifiably accidental homicide should be
provided for by Delphic legislation is a most noteworthy fact.
Such cases are mentioned in Dracon’s laws, and we presume
that they found a place in other Greek written codes. The
reference to ‘public games’ suggests unmistakably an international
code of laws. Here, then, we find Plato, a member of
that Attic State which prided itself on the early foundation<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
of the Delphinium court, for the trial of justifiable homicide, in
the time of its first Ionian Kings, advising a conformity to
Delphic legislation in homicides of this kind! This scholium,
if properly weighed and considered, would in itself be almost
sufficient to demonstrate our theory of the Delphic origin of
historical Greek homicide-laws, and of the universal similarity
of these laws. We cite it here, however, as a mere link in a
chain of evidence which is still very far from completion.</p>

<p>We have already referred<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> to the exclusion of homicide-exiles
from Amphictyonic festivals in Greece, and we have maintained
that such a law probably originated in some Amphictyonic
league such as that of Apollo at Delphi. The same reasoning
applies to the law quoted by Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> as a law of Dracon,
which protected the lives of homicide exiles abroad. The law
reads: ‘If anyone shall slay a murderer or cause his death while
he abstains from market-places on the State boundaries and
from (public) games and Amphictyonic festivals, such a person
shall be liable to the same penalties as if he had killed an
Athenian citizen.’ We have already<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> suggested the origin
of such a law. It was, we think, due to the influence of tribal
custom in conflict with the new doctrine of ‘pollution,’ in the
seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Demosthenes does not understand correctly
the origin of the law, though he is reasonably successful
in explaining the law.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> ‘What,’ he says, ‘was the legislator’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
object? (He thought) that if we slay people who have fled
to other countries, others will slay those who have fled to us:
if this happens, the only refuge left for the unfortunate wretches
will be abolished ... also he strove to prevent an indefinite
series in the avenging of (such) crimes.... He considered
that if a man who is tried for murder, and condemned, once
escapes securely, though he ought (also) to be expelled from
the native State of the victim, it is not righteous to kill him
in every place.’ Demosthenes forgets that it was quite possible
for ancient Greek States to make an international compact
such as appears to operate between States of the modern world,
whereby all murderers who fled abroad would be <i>extradited</i>—not
slain where they had taken refuge, but handed over to the
State of the ‘victim.’ We shall see presently<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> how the
Greeks did evolve a system of extradition of a special kind.
All the objects which Demosthenes attributes to the legislator
are the creations of his own rhetorical mind. Why should
he expect pity for ‘unfortunate wretches’ in a legislator who
decreed that, if these wretches remained at home until the
verdict of the court was given, they would inexorably be put
to death? Why should a murderer expect pity from the
relatives of the slain who were polluted by his presence? No,
such a law must have originated in a central international
Amphictyony or oracular authority which, in its legislation,
had to respect the traditions of tribal village communities and
of tribal aristocratic States, traditions which had come down
from distant ages, and could not be suppressed without a
struggle. Tradition held that ‘exile’ saved the murderer’s
life, and it was not felt that such a penalty was not a sufficient
deterrent. New social conditions, new religious doctrines may
have changed men’s conceptions of the deterrent power of
exile, but they had, nevertheless, to respect the old tradition.
The homicide laws of historical Greece are, we believe,<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> a
compromise between central autocratic deterrence and tribal
‘private vengeance.’</p>

<p>In the last clause of the Demosthenic passage which we
have cited there is a reference to the righteousness of slaying
a murderer if he did not abstain from the ‘land’ of the victim
where that ‘land’ or State was different from his own. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
fail to understand how such a law could have existed, or could
have effectively operated, without an international compact
expressly made or tacitly adopted through the mouthpiece of
an Amphictyonic oracle. We cannot accept Glotz’s theory<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
that the immunity of homicide exiles abroad originated in
separate treaties of Refuge or ἀσυλία. The law is much too
wide and universal to permit of such an explanation. Thus,
for instance, if an Athenian slew a Theban at Athens or at
Thebes, the murderer was bound, after conviction, to abstain
from Athens and Thebes for the rest of his life. No single
Greek state could have produced such a law. Such eventualities
would inevitably require an international compact or an
Amphictyonic sanction.</p>

<p>Plato confirms the existence of these laws. Speaking of involuntary
homicide, he says<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>: ‘It is necessary that the slayer
should withdraw from the (country of the) slain and evacuate
his own native land for a year: if the deceased is a stranger,
let the homicide be debarred from the stranger’s “land” for
the same period.’ Speaking of wilful murderers, he says<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>:
‘If he goes abroad without challenging a verdict (μὴ θέλησας
κρίσιν ὑποσχεῖν), let him suffer perpetual exile: but if any
such person sets foot upon the “land” of the slain, let
whoever first meets him, whether relative (of slain) or citizen,
slay him with impunity, or ... hand him to the magistrates
... to put him to death.’</p>

<p>So far we have assumed that only two States were involved
in the homicide. But let us suppose that an Athenian slew
a Theban at Argos. It would seem that the Athenian slayer, if
he elected to become an exile rather than to die, was debarred
from three places or rather three States, namely, Athens, Thebes
and Argos. Plato, speaking of involuntary homicide between
strangers, metics, and citizens, says<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>: ‘If a stranger involuntarily
kills a stranger in the city, let anyone who wishes prosecute
him in accordance with the same laws: if the slayer is
a metic, let him go into exile for a year: if he is a complete
foreigner, let him, if he shall have killed a stranger or a metic or
a citizen, be banished for his whole life from the country which
has power over these laws,<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and if he returns contrary to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
law let the guardians of the laws punish him with death.’ The
city which has ‘authority or power in regard to these laws’
must be, in this case, the city in which the deed took place.
Thus, a person guilty of involuntary homicide could in certain
circumstances be debarred for ever from the place in which the
deed occurred, and for at least a year from the land of the
victim and also from his native land. Who could have enacted
such laws except an international authority?</p>

<p>The operation of such an authority is also revealed in the
laws regarding ἀνδροληψία, or the seizure of hostages,
when a murderer was not tried or punished by a ‘foreign’
State. A law which is attributed to Dracon, but which clearly
must have had its origin in some national or central Greek
authority of pre-Draconian days, reads as follows<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>: ‘If
anyone dies a violent death, his relations shall be entitled to
take hostages on his behalf, until (the people concerned) either
challenge a verdict of murder at a trial (δίκας τοῦ φόνου
ὑπόσχωσιν) or extradite the slayers: and the taking of
hostages shall extend to three persons but not more.’ The
meaning of the law may be thus illustrated: if an Athenian
slew a Theban at Argos, and if the Argives ignored the deed, and
no one prosecuted the slayer, the relatives of the Theban could
come to Argos and seize the first three men whom they met,
and hold them as hostages till the Argives either tried the slayer
or handed him up to the Thebans. We have taken an extreme
case, but it is such a case which Demosthenes has in mind when
he comments<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> on the law. In historical Greece, the duty
of prosecution was normally limited to the relatives of the
slain. The slaying of strangers was therefore likely to pass
without prosecution. But this right of ἀνδροληψία was an
important corrective of the laxity of this system. Relatives,
living at a distance, ignorant of the actual slayer, might be
regarded as impotent since they knew not whom to accuse.
But the seizure of hostages would speed up the revelation of
the criminal!</p>

<p>We may distinguish three different cases of ἀνδροληψία.
(<i>a</i>) If an Athenian slew a Theban at Thebes, that is, if a
stranger slew a citizen, then the relatives of the slain who
were on the spot could ascertain easily enough the identity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
of the slayer and could put him on trial. If after conviction
he fled to his native State, that State was bound to put him
to death. If he remained after trial in the State of the slain,
which, in this case, was also the State in which the deed took
place, he was also put to death. But if he fled before trial
to his own State, and if his fellow-citizens did not try him
and punish him, or arrest and surrender him, the relatives of
the slain could legally seize as hostages three of his fellow-citizens.
(<i>b</i>) If an Athenian slew a Theban at Athens, that is,
if a citizen slew a stranger, then the relatives of the slain, being
aliens, had the right to prosecute through a προστάτης; but
if the slayer was not tried or surrendered, seizure of hostages
followed, for such seizure was the only means by which this
result could be secured, and ultimately the slayer was debarred
both from Athens and from Thebes. (<i>c</i>) If an Athenian slew
a Theban at Argos, and if the slayer remained at Argos,
unpunished, or if he fled to Athens and enjoyed immunity there,
the relatives of the slain Theban were entitled to seize three
Argives or three Athenians, as the case might be, in order to
compel his surrender. The city which harboured him had
either to put him on trial or to give him up to the relatives of the
slain. We may infer from Plato that, if he were convicted of
manslaughter at Argos, his punishment would have been more
severe than if he were convicted at Athens of slaying an
Athenian in Athens! But we presume that he could have
elected to stand his trial at Athens, if the Theban relatives
agreed to accept the verdict of an Athenian court.</p>

<p>The wording of the Draconian extradition law is vague
and incomplete. The emergencies which it does not expressly
indicate were no doubt provided for by an Apolline Amphictyonic
code, which was either unwritten or, if committed to writing,
was kept secret, or if promulgated, has left no trace of itself
in inscriptions or in literature. But we fail to see how even
the Draconian law could have ever originated in any one
State, or in the mind of a single legislator. We believe that it
was, on the contrary, of international or Amphictyonic origin.
We have suggested, moreover,<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> that the homicide penalties
of historical Greece were the result of a compromise between
the religion of Apollo and the traditions of local State-gods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
and of the Erinnyes who represented the wrath of the slain
and the desire of the relatives for retribution. Does not
this theory help to explain and does it not therefore derive
support from the fact that the punishment of homicide was
most severe and the duty of prosecution most widely diffused
in the case of homicide committed in a State in which both
slayer and slain were legally ‘strangers’?</p>

<p>Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> who sees in the protection of a murderer’s life
‘abroad’ (which means, as we now see, anywhere outside
the one, two, or three States which might be involved in the
case) the operation of treaties of ἀσυλία or Refuge between
individual States, explains the extradition law regarding the
seizure of hostages as an ancient tradition of the clans. Indicating
the contrast which exists between ancient and modern
extradition, he observes<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>: ‘En Grèce, l’extradition a de
bonne heure figuré dans le droit des gens. Mais elle n’était
pas du tout à l’origine ce qu’elle est devenue. Les peuples
civilisés des temps modernes ont pour principe de livrer des
étrangers présumés coupables de crimes commis en pays
étranger, mais non pas leurs nationaux, même pour crimes
commis sur terre étrangère. Les anciens se faisaient un point
d’honneur de ne pas abandonner le malheureux qui s’était
enfui sur leur sol et confié en leur protection. L’hôte est
toujours sacré: le foyer d’une cité est un asile inviolable ...
c’est l’extradition telle qu’ont pratiquée longtemps les Aryens,
<i>ut populus religione solvatur</i>.’ It was, according to this view,
only a sense of honour, a fear of violating the sacred rights
of hospitality, which gave to Greek extradition law its peculiar
characteristics. But criminals cannot claim any right of
hospitality, in the ordinary sense. Moreover, Glotz forgets
that a Greek State had to expel or deliver up a stranger if
the deed of blood was committed in its territory. It also had
to give up its ‘nationals’ if these ‘nationals’ had slain
foreigners at home or abroad. Glotz draws too fine, too
neat a contrast between ancient and modern extradition.
He does not explain the origin of the ancient system. To
say that it existed in early clan-law but that it developed
later into something quite different is not an explanation of
it. Clan-extradition arose, we believe, as a solvent of war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
between the clans concerned. The tribal court or the city
court may possibly have acted in Pelasgian times as a medium
for the operation of this solvent. But the historical system
of extradition, with all its minute differentiations and variations,
bears, we think, the stamp of Amphictyonic legislation
in the age of aristocratic rule in Greece, or in what we may
call the Apolline era. It was only when homicide became an
offence against an international god at Delphi, that is, in the
seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that such legislation came to be applied
to this kind of ‘crime.’ This is our explanation of the origin
of the law. It was an international compact issued in the form
of an oracle.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the interference of oracles in international
disputes we will cite one or two passages from
Herodotus. At the battle of Thermopylae in 480 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Leonidas,
the famous king and commander of the Spartan band, was
slain, and Xerxes, the Persian king, mutilated the corpse
by decapitation and crucifixion.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> This act is regarded by
Herodotus as a barbarous violation of the customs of war,
and is attributed by him to the rage and anger of Xerxes at
the time. The Spartans seem to have been able to present
the act afterwards as a case for damages, and they secured
the support of the Delphic oracle. When the Persians had
failed in their expedition against Greece, and Xerxes was
returning to the Hellespont, ‘an oracle came from Delphi
to the Lacedaemonians bidding them ask satisfaction from
Xerxes for the death of Leonidas and accept that which
should be given by him.’<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Xerxes ridiculed the suggestion
at first, but later he referred the herald to Mardonius, who
would, he said, pay satisfaction. At the battle of Plataea
Mardonius was slain, and then, says Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> ‘the satisfaction
for the death of Leonidas was paid by Mardonius according
to the oracle given to the Spartans.’ Again, we are told<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
that after the Persian conquest of Lydia, Cyrus charged
Mazares to bring to him alive a certain Pactyas, a leading
anti-Persian rebel. Pactyas fled to Kyme, and when
messengers came from Cyrus demanding his ‘extradition,’
‘the Kymeans resolved to consult the deity at Branchidai
as to the course which they should follow.... For there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
was there an oracle established of olden time, which all the
Ionians and Aeolians used to consult’: and ‘when they thus
inquired, the answer was given them that they should deliver
up Pactyas to the Persians.’ Herodotus says that the Kymeans
did not give up Pactyas, as they suspected the oracle of political
designs. Later, the oracular shrine informed them that they
were bidden to deliver up Pactyas only in order that they
should be punished by the gods for contemplating the violation
of a suppliant’s rights! This does not imply, as Glotz<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
supposes, that such rights belonged to murderers, for Pactyas
was not a murderer. We cite the passage here merely to
illustrate the custom of consulting oracles in ‘extradition’
disputes.</p>

<p>The theory which connects Apollo with the doctrine of
homicide as a ‘pollution’ finds further confirmation in many
Greek legends. The story of the purgation of Ixion by Zeus,
which is first referred to by Pindar<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and by Aeschylus,<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
is, we think, an instance of ‘reconstruction,’ or ‘retrojection,’
on the part of legend-makers who were less concerned with
the matter of consistency in the character of Zeus than with
the maintenance of his exalted rôle in the Olympian religion
of post-Homeric days, which tended to extol Apollo the Son
over Zeus the Father. Sidgwick’s view<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> that this legend
originated in an attempt to derive the name <i>Ixion</i> from the
root ἴκ as found in the words ἱκέτης and ἱκετεύειν (which refer
to suppliant-rights) seems to us very probable. Pindar has
perhaps been misinterpreted by Verrall<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> in the translation
of ἐμφύλιον αἷμα as kindred-murder. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> that
the word ἔμφυλος sometimes carries this meaning in Homer.
But in the Pindaric narrative it was his father-in-law whom
Ixion slew, and fathers-in-law are not, as a rule, akin in blood
to their sons-in-law, though they may belong to the same
tribe (φυλή). Pindar asserts that the act of Ixion was malicious:
but we have said<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> that for malicious kin-slaying purgation
was not possible: ‘Of a kindred blood defiled,’ says Plato,<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
‘there is no other cleansing ... before the life that has
sinned shall pay kin blood for kin blood.’ Hence, it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
to suppose that Ixion was not akin to his victim. The
legend of the purgation of Ixion is open to suspicion on the
further ground that Ixion is said<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> to have been the first who
‘supplicated’ for purgation, and is said to have been purged
<i>by Zeus</i>. Now Apollo, not Zeus, was the pioneer amongst
the Purifying gods (καθάρσιοι θεοί). It was Apollo who
purified Orestes, in the legend which Aeschylus follows in the
<i>Eumenides</i>.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> ‘Mine was the house,’ says Apollo, ‘and mine
the hearth which received this suppliant, and I am the purger
of his blood-guilt.’</p>

<p>We shall see, later,<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> what a difficult problem the Homeric
saga of Orestes presented to the legend-makers of the ‘Apolline’
era (750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards). There was only one means by which
the Homeric story could be retained without assuming an
atrocious indifference to kin-slaying on the part of the Homeric
Greeks: namely, by representing the act of Orestes as in some
way justified. But the Apolline code, if we may regard
Plato as a worthy exponent of it, did not admit a plea of
justification for the slaying of a parent in any circumstances.
‘In what other way (than by death),’ says Plato, ‘would
it be right to punish one whom no law will permit, even in
self-defence and in danger of his life, to slay his father or
mother ... and whom (the legislator) will bid to suffer
anything rather than perpetrate such a deed?’<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> We are
convinced that there was one thing, and one thing only, which
would have been accepted by Plato as a justification for such
an act, namely, the express command of Apollo himself.
Apollo was the reputed founder of the Attic Court Delphinium;
he was regarded as the initiator of the distinction between just
and unjust slaying<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>: he appointed and controlled the Exegetae
or the Sacred Interpreters of the laws of ‘purgation’<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>;
surely his command, impossible to disobey, would have been
admitted as a justification for the deed of Orestes. In the
<i>Eumenides</i><a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> of Aeschylus, Orestes says to Apollo: ‘Be
thou my witness: show, Apollo, whether I slew her justly.
The fact of slaying I do not deny: do thou decide whether
in thy judgment I slew her justly or not, that I may tell these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
judges here.’ And Apollo replies<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>: ‘I am a prophet and
will not deceive: never, in my oracular shrine, have I said
aught that Zeus, the father of Olympian gods, doth not command.
Take note, ye judges, of the value of such a justification.’
So, in the <i>Electra</i> of Sophocles, Orestes says<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>:
‘When I approached the oracular shrine of Pytho, to learn
whereby I might punish the murderers of my sire, Phoebus
made answer: “No host of shielded warriors, but thine own
guileful craft, O prince, and thine own arm shall deal the
death-blow righteously.”’ Even in the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides,
a drama in which, as we shall see,<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the plea of justifiable
matricide is almost entirely absent, Orestes tells the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>:
‘Behold! Apollo, who in his palace in mid-earth gives to
mortals oracles most clear, by whom we are entirely guided—him
I obeyed when I slew my mother. ’Twas he who erred,
not I. Is it not enough to remove “pollution” if I transfer
the guilt to the god?’</p>

<p>Again, in the post-Homeric form of the legend of the
Theban Oedipus, it is Apollo who commands the Thebans to
search for the murderer of Laius, and, when they have found
him, to put him to death or to drive him from the land.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
In this option of death or exile we have the normal Attic,
and, therefore,<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> the normal Greek penalty for wilful murder.
The direction which Apollo gives, in the <i>Oedipus Rex</i> of
Sophocles, is quite general.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Apollo speaks therefore as a
lawgiver, and as a deity angered by unpunished homicide,
rather than as a prophet; since he conceals for a time his
knowledge of the slayer of Laius. In historical Greek law
the penalty for parricide was invariably death. If Apollo
had proclaimed the death penalty without the option of exile,
for the slayer of Laius, the famous drama of Sophocles would
have had to be considerably if not fundamentally altered.
The area of the ‘search’ would have been limited to the
kinsmen of the deceased Laius. The Homeric story of Oedipus
is so very different from the later ‘tragic’ story that the evolution
of the legend must have been attended with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
difficulty. Legend-makers could not ignore the Homeric saga
which told<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> how Oedipus, having slain his father, ruled over
the Cadmeans, even though ‘the gods revealed these things
to men.’ How was this fact to be explained from the standpoint
of the post-Homeric doctrine of ‘pollution’ according to
which all wilful parricides were inexorably put to death? We
have suggested that Homer did not understand the mysterious
immunity of Oedipus, and that this immunity was derived
from a Pelasgian story, based on Pelasgian legal distinctions,
to the effect that Oedipus did not really know that it was his
father whom he slew, and that therefore Oedipus could not
be regarded as a parricide of full guilt. It is also possible
to suppose that the old Pelasgian story contained a reference
to a further extenuation of Oedipus’ guilt, namely, a certain
<i>provocation</i> on the part of Laius and his attendants; Sophocles
says that Oedipus was insulted by the herald of Laius and that
Laius smote him on the head with his goad.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Sophocles
tells us also that when all the facts concerning the death of
Laius had come to light, Kreon, instead of proceeding to punish
Oedipus, decided to consult again the oracle at Delphi. Thus,
when Oedipus, anxious to avail himself of the option of exile,
asks Kreon to drive him from the land, Kreon answers<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>:
‘Assuredly I should have already done so, did I not first
desire to learn from the god what should be done.’ Now if
the deed of Oedipus had nothing to extenuate it beyond the
fact that he did not know his father when he slew him, he
would still have had to suffer the penalties of wilful murder,
namely, death or perpetual exile. If, then, Kreon did not
immediately proceed to punish Oedipus, but consulted Apollo a
second time, this must be attributed either to the element of
involuntariness or to the element of provocation, or to both
these elements in the legend of Oedipus. These elements of
provocation and involuntariness are most important for the
legal intelligibility of the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i>, as we shall see
later.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> At present we wish to emphasise the fact that this
legend, like the legend of Orestes, became, so to speak,
‘Apollinised’ in post-Homeric times. Such transitions are
only intelligible if we assume a connexion between Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and ‘pollution.’ We may infer that, in the post-Homeric
legend, Apollo took a lenient view of the guilt of Oedipus,
from the fact that, in the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i>, the responsibility
for his continued exile is laid not upon Apollo, but upon Kreon
and the sons of Oedipus, who wish to enjoy the vacant throne
of Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> According to Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Oedipus’ sons imprisoned
him, but Kreon drove him into exile.</p>

<p>In the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> it is Apollo who saves
Orestes from the wrath of the Argives who have condemned
him to death. Apollo decrees that, when Orestes has endured a
period of exile and has submitted to a trial at Athens, the
Argives must accept as their king a man whom they had already
deemed worthy of an ignominious death! In the <i>Electra</i>
of Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Castor and Pollux refer, by way of prophecy,
to the fact that Apollo will ultimately secure Orestes’ deliverance
from the Erinnyes.</p>

<p>In the <i>Ion</i> of Euripides<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> the Pythian priestess of
Apollo commands Ion not to slay Creusa, who had attempted
to poison him, and who otherwise would have urged in vain
her plea of self-defence and the sacredness of her sanctuary.</p>

<p>In the <i>Andromache</i> of Euripides, Apollo is criticised for
having permitted the slaying of Neoptolemus within the precincts
of the temple at the hands of Orestes and the Delphians.
The Messenger says<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>: ‘Thus has the Lord who gives oracles
to others, who is the umpire for all men of what is right, requited
the son of Achilles ... like any wicked mortal, he stores in
his memory an ancient quarrel.’</p>

<p>Thus the conception of homicide as a pollution permeates
all Greek tragedy: however various the legends, however
different the localities to which they refer, they all breathe
the same Apolline atmosphere. We have already<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> quoted
Herodotus’ opinion as to the universality of the ‘purgation’
rites by which the pollution of homicide was cleansed. If it
be true, moreover, that the laws which regulated the historical
Greek treatment of homicide were more or less identical in
all the more important and advanced Greek States, would not
this fact suggest that the origin of these laws must be sought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
not in the genius of occasional local legislators, but rather in
the simultaneous universal operation of identical causes? One
of these causes, we believe, was the doctrine of pollution.</p>

<p>The legends of Attic tragedy on the whole suggest a
uniform system of murder-law in historical Greece. In
Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i><a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> we are told that Orestes did not follow
‘the common law of the Greeks.’ In the <i>Heracleidae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Eurystheus, referring to a threat of murder on the part of
Alcmene, says: ‘By the laws of the Greeks, if I am slain
I shall cause my slayer to be polluted.’ In the <i>Hercules
Furens</i>,<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Hercules, the slayer of his children, feels that
men’s doors will be closed against him in all parts of Greece,
without exception. We have already<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> referred to the possibility
that a more severe code of penalties for homicide existed
at Sparta than in other parts of Greece. Xenophon<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> says
that a certain Dracontius was condemned to perpetual exile
for involuntary homicide. If we have here a really exceptional
penalty, we must attribute it to the peculiarly military character
of the Spartan State. But can we be sure that the
penalty was exceptional? Plato decrees perpetual exile for
involuntary slaying between strangers in any given State<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>;
moreover, for slaying in a passion, which is quasi-involuntary,
he decrees perpetual exile for the second offence.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Xenophon
does not give us sufficient details about Dracontius to enable
us to regard this penalty as a definite exception. Again, in
regard to Crete, we have indicated<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> the absence of any reference
to wergeld in the laws of Gortyn. This shows the influence
of some universal Greek doctrine which led to its abolition.
The fact that Apollo was said to have received many of his
Delphic priests from Crete,<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and the fame of the Cretan
purifier, Epimenides, in the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, point to the
same conclusion.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Wergeld and Private Settlement</span></h5>

<p>We must now discuss more fully the question: did the
pollution doctrine abolish wergeld? We can answer this
question satisfactorily by merely answering another question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
which is intimately connected with it, namely: ‘was “private
settlement” legal in historical Athens?’—‘was it lawful for the
relatives of the slain, if they so wished, to abstain from prosecution,
and could they legally accept from the slayer a bribe or a
gift if they so abstained?’ We do not deny the fact that such
settlements did occasionally take place; but if these settlements
were legal, then our theory that pollution abolished
wergeld cannot stand. We are glad to be able to quote the
authority of Philippi<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in favour of the illegality of ‘private
settlement,’ but as the arguments of Philippi are rejected by
Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> we must in turn reject the arguments of Glotz!
It is strange that Müller, who holds<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> that wergeld originated
in ‘pollution,’ maintains that in historical times ‘private
settlement’ was not valid except in cases of involuntary
slaying.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of clearness we will summarise our own conclusions
in advance. We believe that ‘private settlement’
was permitted by law or custom—it was not <i>expressly</i> prohibited
or permitted by any written code—whenever a ‘release’
from blood-guilt on the part of the victim, before death, was
<i>formally granted</i>, or, in the absence of a ‘charge,’ could be
<i>tacitly assumed</i>; but that otherwise ‘private settlement’ was
a sin, a religious quasi-criminal offence, and must therefore have
been legally invalid, in the sense that the offender was liable
to prosecution.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> This view is not only consistent with,
but is in part derived from, our theory of the incompatibility
of ‘pollution’ and wergeld. ‘Private settlement’ is not,
of course, wergeld in the strict sense, but it has this much
in common with it, that it allowed the slayer to remain in his
native State for the rest of his life. His presence was not a
cause of pollution.</p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> that the Greek religious doctrine of
homicide as a ‘pollution’ expresses a compromise between the
newly evolved power of synoekised States and the traditions
of the tribes, between the ideals of an international autocratic
Apollo and the claims of the Erinnyes of the slain who reflected
the desires of the dead and of their relatives. It follows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
whenever the laws which resulted from this compromise were
observed, whenever the prescribed penalty or atonement was
paid, Apollo and the Erinnyes were logically compelled to
accept the ‘appeasement’ and to signify by their consent,
in certain cases, to the ceremonial of ‘purgation’ that the
‘pollution’ of the criminal was washed away. But it was
never forgotten that, in theory, the pollution of the slayer
had a twofold source: that the stigma of bloodshed was, so to
speak, bicellular, and was expressive of the anger of Apollo, on
the one hand, and of the anger of the Erinnyes on the other.
It is obvious, therefore, that a ‘release’ on the part of a dying
victim precluded any serious anger on the part of the Erinnyes,
whereas a victim’s solemn command to his relatives to prosecute
his slayer<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> set in motion the entire supernatural vigour of
the avenging Erinnyes. Thus in the <i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
the Furies tend to go to sleep and to forget until they are goaded
into activity by the ghost of the slain Clytaemnestra. Hence
it is correct to maintain that in the event of a formal or presumed
‘release’ on the part of a dying victim, the slayer was
not in any real sense polluted. In such cases, the slayer may
have had to undergo ‘purgation’ of a minor kind, one of these
local supplementary ‘purgations’ which were intended to free
the citizens from religious scruple.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Purgation, we have
said, was not symbolical of guilt, but rather of atoned guilt or
of innocence. But in such cases the slayer was not really
‘polluted.’ His presence in his homeland did not anger the
dead or the gods. But if the dying victim did not formally
release his slayer, if he charged his relatives to prosecute,
then in all cases, even in the event of justifiable homicide,
the slayer was ‘polluted’ until he was formally purged. This
purgation could not be performed by any ordinary person or
at any ordinary time. The conditions of its performance were
regulated by Delphic law and by State law. Once charged
by the relatives of the slain, the accused had either to admit
guilt or to advance a ‘plea,’ and the civic penalty had to be
paid before purgation was permitted.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how Glotz can attribute to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
‘pollution’ a considerable influence in abolishing ‘private
vengeance’ and in necessitating State interference in homicide,<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
and at the same time maintain<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> that in historical
State justice ‘private settlement’ was legal as an option for
prosecution. Attic law proves that the slayer was ‘polluted’
during the long period of time—three or four months—which
intervened between the first public accusation, at the funeral
of deceased, and the trial.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> He could not enter the city
temples, or frequent the public places, under penalty of death.
Glotz admits<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> that a person who was accused but unconvicted
of murder was ‘polluted,’ but he seems to think that
the pollution could be privately purged or ignored altogether.
‘Before the public <i>accusation</i>,’ one may say, ‘the slayer was
not polluted.’ He was perhaps not publicly known to be
‘polluted,’ we admit. But in reality we believe that he was
polluted when the ‘victim’ died without ‘release.’ If the
relatives chose to hush the matter up, this did not destroy the
real ‘pollution.’ If the matter became known to the public,
these relatives could themselves be indicted on a charge of
impiety.<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> They had broken the religious laws, the unwritten
customs, of the State. They could not righteously ‘settle’
except in the event of ‘release.’</p>

<p>We will now support and illustrate our views by a few
quotations. Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> tells us that ‘if the victim
(ὁ παθών) himself releases the slayer from guilt of blood before
he (the victim) dies, it is not lawful for the relatives to prosecute.’
This is a most important piece of evidence, although
the context in which it occurs is vitiated by rhetorical exaggeration.
It means, in effect, that in any kind of homicide<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
the relatives of the slain were powerless in regard to prosecution
if the dying man ‘released’ his slayer and did not ‘charge’
them to avenge him. Thus even the homicide laws of a theocratic
Apollo and of centralised Greek governments depend
for their operation on the will of the victim. In such an event<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
the slayer was not ‘polluted.’ No impiety, no illegality was
involved in ‘private settlement’ in such a case; on the contrary,
to prosecute the slayer would probably have been
impious. Not even a charge of involuntary homicide (which
was possible in the case of simple ‘forgiveness’ on the part of
the dying) could be brought against the slayer, if the victim
‘released’ him from all guilt of blood. This decree of the
dying was tantamount to a ‘release’ in law; it did not merely
reduce the charge to one of justifiable or accidental slaying.
Hence the ‘private settlement,’ which no doubt occasionally
occurred in such cases, was not so much a bribe offered to
prevent prosecution as an informal offer of material retribution—a
relic of the old-time wergeld traditions of tribal
Greece.</p>

<p>In a speech of Lysias which is concerned with political or
judicial murder, we are told<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> that one of the condemned,
named Dionysodorus, summoned his brother and sister and
brother-in-law to prison before he died and charged them
‘and all his kindred’ (φίλοις) to punish as a murderer
Agoratus who had given the false information which led to
his condemnation. Thus we see converted into a charge of
wilful murder an act which ordinarily would have been regarded
as political perjury. The relatives of Dionysodorus actually
decided to take the law into their own hands<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>—political
ferment demands such drastic action—and they would have
slain Agoratus as a criminal (κακοῦργος) if Anytus, the general,
had not persuaded them, on grounds of public policy and
expediency, to desist. The Thirty Tyrants acquitted Agoratus
later, presumably because of political prejudice. The plaintiff
in this speech<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> appeals to the Heliasts to do the pious and
just thing and to condemn him to death. Thus we see how
the relatives of a slain man were directed and compelled by
the ‘charge’ of the dying. There was nothing involuntary
about this case of homicide, as some writers seem to assume.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
It was deliberate political murder.</p>

<p>Müller says<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>: ‘When a verdict of manslaughter was
returned it was allowable for the prosecutor and the accused
to enter into a compromise on the spot, if they pleased.’ He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
admits, however, that ‘in the regular mode of procedure,
the convict quitted his country by a certain road and at a
certain time and remained absent’ until he ‘appeased’ the
relatives of the slain, ‘whereupon he was permitted to return
home under certain prescribed forms, and, after the due
performance of sacrifices and rites of purification, he was at
liberty to dwell once more in his native land.’ The question
of the ‘appeasement’ of relatives after exile in cases of
involuntary homicide will come up for discussion later.<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
At present we are speaking of ‘compromise,’ or of ‘private
settlement,’ without exile: we may note Müller’s admission
as to the ‘regular mode of procedure.’ He cites no authority
for his statement about a ‘compromise.’ Plato uniformly
insists that a period of exile was always compulsory in cases of
involuntary homicide.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> ‘Forgiveness’ on the part of the
‘dying’—as distinct from ‘release,’ which Plato has not in
mind<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>—always reduced the charge to one of manslaughter.
Hence we have argued that ‘release’ abolished all guilt
and pollution. Speaking of ‘forgiveness’ Plato says<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>: ‘If
any person of his own accord gives an absolution (ἄφεσις) to
anyone for such a deed let the purgations take place for the
slayer as if the act had been involuntary and let there be a
period of one year in exile according to law (ἐν νόμῳ).’ Speaking
of general cases of manslaughter, he says<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>: ‘If anyone kills
involuntarily a freeborn person, let him be purified with the
same purgations as he who has killed a slave and let him not
dishonour a certain ancient legend ... hence the slayer must
withdraw (into exile) ... for all the seasons of a single year.’
The legend which Plato mentions is suggestive: ‘A freeman
slain by violence was,’ he says, ‘angry with his murderer
while his death was still recent ... and seeing his slayer
roaming about in the places which he himself frequented
(when alive) shuddered at the thought and, sore distressed,
harasses with all his might the slayer and his movements, using
memory as an ally in the task.’ Here we can plainly detect
that minor local ‘pollution’ which was caused by the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
resentment of the slain, and such ‘pollution’ could only be
removed by a period of exile. There is a difference, then,
between ‘release’ and ‘forgiveness.’ In the latter case the
slayer was still ‘polluted’: the ghost has absorbed the anger
of the gods which is caused by the shedding of blood. Hence
we think that the relatives were not free, in such a case, to
‘compound’ with the slayer except at the risk of incurring
the anger of the dead and of the gods. We agree with Müller’s
statement regarding Plato<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>—namely, that his ‘scheme of
criminal law is in the main based on the same principles as
the Attic code.’ But in his theory of the legality of ‘private
settlement’ in cases of manslaughter Müller seems to have
omitted to notice these passages which we quoted from Plato.
He was probably influenced, in his judgment, by one or two
passages in Demosthenes which are obviously rhetorical and
which we shall presently discuss.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Glotz also attaches considerable importance to such
Demosthenic passages, forgetting that they are not legal documents
and that they are, moreover, inconsistent with other
passages from the same author. Glotz is anxious to establish
the theory that wergeld was abolished in Athens not by
Dracon, as is generally held, but by Solon, who sought to
exalt the power of the State and to weaken the influence of
the clans. To arrive at this conclusion, Glotz boldly assumes
that a certain clause in a Draconian law, namely that which
forbade the acceptance of ‘ransom’ from a murderer found
in his home-land after conviction, was not inscribed by Dracon
but by Solon.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Our opinion is that neither Dracon nor
Solon abolished wergeld, but that it had been already rendered
sacrilegious by the Apolline doctrine of pollution in the seventh
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The laws of Dracon do not anywhere mention
real wergeld—they simply assume that such a system was
obsolete. But the phrase μηδ’ ἀποινᾶν in the Draconian law,<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
which is usually but quite erroneously connected with wergeld,
suggests, if it does not prove, what Glotz would not
apply to the period of Dracon or of Solon—namely, the fact
that ‘private settlement’ was illegal. Why should a law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
forbid the ‘ransom’ of a murderer’s life after conviction if it
permitted such a ‘ransom’ before conviction? Leaving aside
religious considerations, which we, however, believe to be
essential to the matter, and viewing the question from the
standpoint of Glotz’s own pet hypothesis as to the exaltation
of State power,<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> we believe that the opposite procedure
would have been more logical—that a State would more
naturally have prohibited ‘ransom’ before conviction, but
permitted it afterwards, when the property of the slayer
had found its way into the coffers of the State, and when the
State had extracted all that it could possibly extract from the
unfortunate slayer! But, as a matter of fact, the ‘ransom’
which is prohibited by this law of Dracon was not a real
‘ransom’ of the slayer’s life in the legal sense. It refers only
to a slayer caught ‘en rupture de ban.’ It was merely a bribe
which the slayer would be disposed to offer to any citizen whom
he encountered in order to be allowed to escape from forbidden
territory. His life was still forfeit if he returned again, or
even if he did not succeed in escaping after he had bribed, say,
one citizen, out of the total number of citizens in the State.
The law says: ‘It shall be lawful to kill murderers (found)
in our territory ... but not to amerce them.’ The penalty
for ‘amercement’ was ‘double the amount extorted.’ To
our mind the law suggests the illegality of ‘private settlement’
rather than the abolition of wergeld! Glotz, moreover,
seems to ignore the Demosthenic references to a γραφὴ ἀσεβείας,
an indictment for impiety, which could be brought against
the relatives of a slain person if they did not prosecute the
slayer. We need not dwell upon the importance of a γραφὴ
in Attic law. It denoted a most important species of public
accusation, similar to our modern indictments or impeachments.
Human nature being what it is, and Greek human
nature being what it was, can we conceive that a Greek would
have omitted to propose a ‘private settlement’ if it had been
legal for him to do so, as an option for prosecution? Can
we conceive that prosecutions for homicide would ever have
occurred if such an option would have freed the relatives of
the slain from liability to a charge of impiety which involved
their banishment and the confiscation of their property? We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
must then rather assume that the guilt of impiety would
have been still incurred if the relatives of the slain accepted
‘settlement’ and failed to prosecute.</p>

<p>Glotz makes no reference to the γραφὴ ἀσεβείας. We agree
with him<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> that there was no γραφὴ φόνου in Attic law, but we
do not understand why he should credit Solon with the institution
of γραφαί for ὕβρις and κάκωσις, but omit to mention
ἀσέβεια. The indictment for impiety, which we attribute to
Solon,<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> is incompatible with ‘private settlement’ for homicide,
which Glotz believes to have been legal in the days
of Demosthenes as in those of Solon. Let us see what
Demosthenes has to say of this indictment.</p>

<p>In his speech against Androtion<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> a certain Diodorus says
of Androtion: ‘He accused me of a deed which anyone who
was not of his type would have been afraid to mention, namely,
of slaying my own father: he prepared an indictment of
impiety<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> not against me, but against my uncle, impeaching
him for impiety in associating with one who, as alleged,
had committed this crime; he put him on trial, and if he
happened<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> to be found guilty—what man would have suffered
a more cruel fate than I would at this man’s hands? What
citizen (φίλος) or stranger would have ever consented to associate
with me? What city (<i>i.e.</i> State) would have tolerated
within its precincts a man who appeared to have perpetrated
such an impious deed? None whatever.’ It is noteworthy
that the indictment, which is here referred to, was brought,
not against the alleged parricide, but against his uncle. The
reason is not, as Glotz would maintain,<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> that parricide was
not a crime in historical Athens, but that direct prosecution
of homicides was limited, by a legal technicality, based on
immemorial custom, to the relatives of the slain. If Glotz’s
theory of unrestrained ‘private settlement’<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> is assumed,
what a glorious hunting-ground for unscrupulous blackmailers
must Athens have been! We can conceive Diodorus’ uncle
approaching Diodorus with his hand outstretched and crying
‘Your money or your life’! We can also conceive any outsider—there
is no limit to the number—approaching the uncle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
of Diodorus equally determined to ‘settle’ the indictment for
impiety! This is much too absurd for reality, even in a
modern State, not to speak of the ancient city with its
ubiquitous gods and ghosts and scruples! This passage
explains, incidentally, an episode in the <i>Euthyphro</i> of
Plato.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Euthyphro proposes to accuse his father of homicide,
since a poor freeman in his employment at Naxos, whom his
father had put in chains and cast by the wayside to await the
decision of the Exegetae regarding the slaying of a slave by
his freeman employee, had died of hunger and neglect.
Socrates asks if Euthyphro is a relative of the freeman.
Euthyphro says that he is not, but that he is ‘polluted’ by
associating with his father who is a murderer, and that he is
therefore bound to prosecute him. Plato, as we have said,
is probably here posing a problem which the Attic legal mind
would have found it difficult to solve. But the atmosphere
of the dialogue is very far removed from that of ‘private
settlement’ for homicide.</p>

<p>That the action of Euthyphro was from one point of view
impious (ἀνόσιος), which is to say of doubtful legality, is
suggested by another passage in Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> A nurse
in the employment of the plaintiff died as a result of rough
treatment at the hands of two men who came to his house to
distrain his goods and chattels. The plaintiff tells how he
went to the Interpreters to ask their advice. The Interpreters
said that the only course which was open to him in law was
‘to carry a spear in front of the funeral procession, and at the
tomb to publicly inquire (προαγορεύειν) if the woman had any
relative, and to watch the tomb for three days’! ‘For the
woman,’ they said, ‘was not akin to you, nor even a slave of
yours ... and it is to relatives and “masters” that the law
assigns the duty of prosecution.’ The plaintiff then looked at
a copy of Dracon’s laws and consulted his friends, and taking
into account the fact that he was not a personal witness of
the assault and could not find any witnesses that would weigh
with a court, he obeyed the Interpreters, and refrained from
further action. The Draconian law required, we are told,
that in taking the oath in a murder charge the accuser had to
state definitely in the court in what relationship he stood to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
deceased or whether the deceased was his slave. This technical
legal condition, the demands of this legal formula, could not
be complied with by the plaintiff. Hence it is doubtful if
Euthyphro could have complied with them, unless, perhaps,
he regarded himself as a kind of ‘master’ in relation to the
deceased freeman.</p>

<p>But the indictment for impiety was based on the religious
doctrine of pollution rather than on clan-technicalities connected
with funerals and burial and obsolete wergeld agreements.
It is an instance of unsolved conflict between these
two systems which we find in the <i>Euthyphro</i> and in the
speech <i>against Androtion</i>—a conflict which was in other respects
mitigated by the compromise we have described<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
in historical Greek homicide law. The indictment for impiety
could be brought by any citizen against the relatives of a
murdered man, if they failed to prosecute, and if the dying
man had not given a ‘release.’ If such failure to prosecute was
impious, then surely a ‘private settlement’ which prevented
prosecution was also impious.</p>

<p>We will now examine two passages—one from Demosthenes,
the other from Aristophanes—which Glotz quotes in
support of his theory of the legality of ‘private settlement.’
Glotz’s theory is clearly stated in these words<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>: ‘Il est
improbable que la réconciliation ait été explicitement interdite
et le silence de la loi valait une permission. Par autorisation
formelle ou par tolérance, ouvertement ou tacitement l’Etat
devait consacrer dans tous les cas le privilège de la famille.’
The only thing, in Glotz’s view, that would have forced a
‘recourse to the State’ was the absence of unanimity in the
relatives concerning the amount for which they would ‘settle.’
One dissentient voice compelled a recourse to prosecution.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>In the speech of Demosthenes <i>against Theocrines</i><a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> we
read that a certain Theocrines whose brother had been murdered
threatened to bring Demochares, the alleged murderer, before
the Areopagus, unless he paid him a sum of money. The
money was paid, and that was the end of it! The relevant
passage reads: ‘Not very long after his dismissal, his brother
was slain by violence. Mark how he behaved! He made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
inquiries as to the murderers, and having discovered who they
were, he accepted a sum of money and abandoned further
proceedings. He went round threatening to bring Demochares
before the Areopagus until he “compounded” with the
guilty parties. What an honest and trustworthy man!’
Philippi’s conclusion<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> that the action of Theocrines was
illegal does not convince Glotz, who inquires<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>: ‘Qu’est-ce
donc qui retient Démosthène de flétrir un tel pacte comme
illicite?’ But it is quite obvious that the action of Theocrines
is presented by Demosthenes as unusual and disgraceful. The
object of Demosthenes, in the speech, is to emphasise the
mercenary character of Theocrines. He is more concerned
with this aspect of Theocrines’ action than with its legality
or illegality. We may therefore answer Glotz’s question by
asking another: ‘If this action was legal, why does Demosthenes
refer to it as a disgrace?’ Or, again: ‘Could an act
be described as illegal which was not expressly prohibited by
law?’ Glotz in seeking to prove that ‘private settlement’
was legal infers that it was legal because it is not here declared
illegal! This argument seems to us invalid. Demosthenes
wrote speeches for private and public litigants. Sometimes
he emphasised one point, sometimes the opposite point. He
does not wish to stultify himself unnecessarily. He is not a
self-constituted legislator, as Plato, in his ideal world, was.
He leaves the legal decision to the jury and aims merely at a
victory in the suit. Moreover, we must point out, in Attic
law there was a Statute of Limitations. If Theocrines kept
his secret to himself, and if he had no religious scruples about
the matter, he could, after a number of years, have divulged
it with impunity. But Demosthenes speaks as if the whole
action only took twenty-four hours! This may be excellent
rhetorical skill, but it may also involve a complete distortion
of facts. We admit, of course, that ‘private settlements’
for homicide did occasionally take place in historical Athens,
as they do in modern States. The actuality of such a settlement
may perhaps be inferred from this speech of Demosthenes,
but certainly not the legality of it.</p>

<p>The second text which Glotz adduces in support of his
theory is a passage from the <i>Frogs</i> of Aristophanes,<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
Euripides criticises as a redundant expression the following
Aeschylean verse<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> which describes the return of Orestes to
Argos after his sojourn as an exile in Phocis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ἥκω γὰρ ἐς γῆν τήνδε καὶ κατέρχομαι.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Aeschylus, in reply, denies that there is any redundancy in
the verse, asserting that there is a very real difference between
the home-coming of a citizen and that of an exile. Euripides,
changing his ground, attacks the application of the verb
κατέρχομαι (‘I return from exile’) to Orestes, because, he says,
Orestes came home secretly, without having duly ‘appeased’
by gifts those who were competent to permit his return.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>It does not, says Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> occur to Euripides to say that
no ‘appeasement’ was possible in the case of Orestes; and
since, in the eyes of Aristophanes, the deed of Orestes was
regarded as wilful murder, therefore, Glotz argues, Aristophanes
may be regarded as implying in this passage that a
wilful murderer could always return to his home-land, if
he happened to be abroad, provided he paid ‘compensation’
to the relatives of the slain!</p>

<p>There is a strange but very obvious error in this reasoning.
Glotz has forgotten that in the early portion of the <i>Choephoroe</i>,
in which the verse in question occurs, Orestes has not yet
slain his mother! At this stage, therefore, he was not a
murder-exile at all. He was merely a political or a quasi-political
exile. Homer and later legend are quite clear in
regard to the nature of this exile. Hence, obviously, the
‘persuasion of those in power’ in this passage has no connexion
with homicide, and is, for Glotz’s argument, irrelevant.
The return of political exiles was a common occurrence in
the Greece of Aristophanes and Euripides. The persuasion
used in such cases may have consisted merely of some kind
of promise or undertaking to obey the existing government,
but it may of course occasionally have taken the form of gifts
or bribes. But the ruling power at Argos which Orestes would
have had to persuade consisted of his deadliest enemies,
Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus. He came home without their
sanction and without their knowledge; Euripides therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
is right in his opinion that Orestes did not come home by
permission of the Argive ‘government.’ The verb κατέρχομαι,
which normally implies a formal and ‘recognised’ return, has
not therefore here its normal meaning. Aeschylus is therefore
technically in error in his use of this word, but he is right
in maintaining that there is no verbal redundancy in the
verse.</p>

<p>Apart from the irrelevance of this quotation, as an argument
for the legality of ‘private settlement,’ we may point
out that we have no reason for believing, as Glotz believes,
that Aristophanes regarded Orestes as a wilful murderer.
Aeschylus in the <i>Eumenides</i> makes the Erinnyes say so,<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
but their viewpoint is shown to be mistaken by an Athenian
Court. Euripides also was aware that not only Homer but
several Attic legends conceived Orestes as very different
from a murderer.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> In spite of the variety and the confusion
which characterised the Oresteian legends, Aristophanes,
Euripides and Aeschylus were probably well aware that the
Homeric and legendary accounts of the exile of Orestes at
Athens or at Phocis had no connexion with the penalty for
homicide. We can only say of Glotz’s reasoning here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is another passage in Demosthenes, to which Glotz
seems to attach considerable importance, but which does not
in our view warrant the conclusion which he has drawn from
it. In a speech <i>against Nausimachus</i>, in which an action
for breach of trust is brought by the plaintiff against his
guardian Aristaechmus, who had, fourteen years before,
compromised the dispute by a payment of three talents,
Demosthenes is naturally led, in defence of Aristaechmus
(or his son) the plaintiff, to emphasise the dishonesty of proceeding
with an action where a ‘release’ has been previously
granted. Incidentally, the orator happens to refer to ‘private
settlements’ for homicide in the following passage<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>: ‘This
I presume you will all acknowledge, that other people have
suffered wrongs before now, of a more grievous nature than
pecuniary wrongs, for example, unintentional homicides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
profane outrages and many similar offences are perpetrated;
yet in all these cases the injured parties are finally and conclusively
barred when they have come to a settlement and
given a “release.” This rule of justice is so universally binding
that when a man has convicted another of intentional homicide
and clearly proved him to be “polluted,” yet if he afterwards
condones the crime and “releases” him he has no longer the
right to force the same person into exile. Nor again where
the murdered man has released his murderer before he died,
is it lawful for any of the relatives to prosecute, but those
whom the laws sentence, upon conviction, to banishment or
exile or death, if they have been released, are by that word
“release” at once absolved from all penal consequences.’
This passage is repeated verbatim in the speech <i>against
Pantaenetus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Müller<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> points out that both passages are
‘disputed’ by many scholars. He thinks that there should
only be a reference to involuntary homicide.</p>

<p>It is of course possible that for the word ἐκουσίου
(voluntary) Demosthenes wrote ἀκουσίου (involuntary). So
Müller would emend the passage. But, apart from such a
solution, the very fact that Nausimachus was legally entitled
to sue, even after a ‘compromise’ or ‘release,’ proves that
Demosthenes is rhetorical rather than logical. As the passage
stands, it is in direct conflict with the law of Dracon forbidding
‘amercement’ after conviction, a law which we have already
quoted.</p>

<p>We are convinced that such ‘settlements’ were illegal
and criminal in cases of wilful murder. In manslaughter
cases, at least one year’s exile was necessary, with or without
trial.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In practice some of the relatives may have drawn
up a ‘release’ immediately, and such relatives could not
perhaps take part in expelling the slayer. Our conclusions
on this question will appear more fully later.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> We have
already referred<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> to ‘the release’ which was given by the
dying as a most important factor in Greek homicide-law. We
also admit that ‘settlements’ were occasionally made, though
not legally authorised, and it is clear that such ‘settlements’
could easily be confused with the ‘appeasement’ of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
relatives in manslaughter cases, especially in the pleadings of
an orator.</p>

<p>We should contrast with this Demosthenic passage another
from the speech <i>against Aristocrates</i>,<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> in which there is
reference to involuntary homicide. ‘If,’ he says, ‘the accused
be convicted and be found to have done the deed, neither the
prosecutor nor anyone else has control over him, but the
law alone. And what does the law command? That a
person convicted of involuntary homicide shall on certain
stated days leave the country by an appointed road and
remain in exile until he has appeased certain of the relatives
of the slain ... above all it is right that the laws should
control everybody and everything.’</p>

<p>Similarly, in his speech against Meidias,<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> a judge who
accepted money in settlement of a prosecution for ‘assault’
is said to have taken no account of the laws: and another man
who ‘settled’ a case of assault is said ‘to have bidden farewell
to the laws.’</p>

<p>As an instance of Demosthenes’ rhetorical skill in the
distortion of the meaning of words, we may refer to a passage
in the Third Philippic.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The question at issue was really
one of treason, not of murder. A certain Arthmius of Zelea
(in Asia), having distributed Persian gold for political purposes
at the time of the Persian invasion of Greece, was solemnly
declared ἄτιμος by the Athenian people. Now a decree of
ἄτιμία for treason involved much more severe consequences
than the historical exile penalty for murder. It was the sole
historical survival of collective and hereditary punishment,
and involved not only the traitor but also his family and all
his posterity (αὐτός τε καὶ γένος).<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> In practice, no doubt,
it was but a trifling penalty to an Asiatic, like Arthmius,
who had no intention of living at Athens or in the Athenian
confederacy. But Arthmius was declared by this decree
to be an outlaw within the territory of Attica or within the
Athenian Empire. If found within this territory, he, or his
descendants, could be slain with impunity. Demosthenes,
anxious to illustrate the patriotism of the Athenians of former
days, compared with that of his contemporaries, by showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the severity with which treason was formerly punished, even
in a foreigner, has recourse to the subtle hypothesis that ἄτιμος
in the decree against Arthmius did not mean merely ‘degraded’
from civic rights but should be linked up with a verb
τεθνάτω, to form a clause which means ‘let him be slain with
impunity.’ The word ἄτιμος in this decree has, he says,
the same significance as it bears in the murder-laws ‘in the
case of murderers for whom the legislator forbids a prosecution
for homicide,’ where it is said ‘ἄτιμος τεθνάτω.’ It is true
that the word ἄτιμος could be used to mean ‘unpunished,’
but when the Athenians declared a person ἄτιμος, they meant
by the word ‘degraded’ not ‘unpunished.’ They declared
the person ‘dishonoured,’ or degraded from civic privileges.
Moreover, in the laws of Dracon as Demosthenes quotes them
the word ἄτιμος does not occur, and the adverb used to
denote ‘with impunity’ is νηποινεί. Plato also has ἀνατί.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Demosthenes, then, is quite capable of juggling with words
and with the wording of laws, in his desire to secure a
rhetorical victory. But here Demosthenes, without knowing
it, weakens the very point which he desires to emphasise.
A decree of ἄτιμία for treason was much more severe than
any penalty in the Attic murder laws. A murder-exile could
be slain with impunity, as a traitor could, if found within
Athenian territory. But his descendants could not! His
family could remain securely at Athens, in full enjoyment
of civic rights. If the word ἄτιμος in the decree against
Arthmius meant what Demosthenes asserts that it meant in
the murder-laws, then it is incorrect to speak of the punishment
of the traitor and his descendants (αὐτός τε καὶ γένος).
Now what does Demosthenes mean by the phrase ‘in cases
where the legislator forbids a trial for homicide’<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>? The
context gives the only possible meaning: he means, in cases
where <i>an already convicted murderer</i> returned to forbidden
territory and could be slain with impunity without trial.</p>

<p>We shall return to this question in our next chapter, when
treating of manslaughter in Attic law, but we may for the
present conclude, as the most probable hypothesis, that in
historical Athens ‘private settlement’ as a means of absolution
from homicide guilt was sinful and legally punishable, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
all cases where the dying victim did not grant a ‘release’
and where a public prosecution was otherwise legally possible.
This hypothesis, if correct, shows that amongst the Greeks,
as amongst the Semites, wergeld was abolished by the religious
doctrine of homicide as a ‘pollution,’ as an offence against
supernatural beings.</p>

<p>Assuming, as a result of our general reasoning in this
chapter, and for other reasons which will presently appear,
that the historical murder laws of Greece were as universal
and as uniform as the Greek purgation-rites for homicide,
assuming that the novelties which they contain, in regard to
their ideals of punishment, and their insistence on compulsory
State trial, were not the creation of local legislators, but the
product of international Amphictyonies which expressed their
compacts in oracular decrees—compacts which were only
gradually evolved in a compromise between local customs or
desires and a new religious doctrine which was adopted from
Asiatic peoples—we will now proceed to a brief colligation of
the Laws of Dracon concerning homicide, and after giving
such commentaries as these laws may seem to demand, we
will then review the Attic murder-courts and offer an explanation
of their origin and evolution.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DRACONIAN CODE</span></h3>

<p>Restored inscription of 409-8 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and author’s explanation: other Draconian
homicide-laws derived from Demosthenes: Plato’s code confirms and
supplements these data: classification of Attic homicide laws as follows:
(<i>a</i>) those relating to accidental homicide, to death caused by animals
or inanimate objects; and to homicide by persons unknown: (<i>b</i>) those
relating to justifiable and to justifiably accidental homicide: (<i>c</i>) those
relating to manslaughter: (<i>d</i>) those relating to wilful murder: some
problems suggested by these laws: origin of confiscation of property:
evolution of State-execution: parricide and kin-slaying: historicity
of Plato’s legislation regarding homicide.</p>

</div>

<p>The only direct source of evidence which we possess for the
historical murder-laws of Attica—for the murder-laws of other
Greek States we have no direct evidence at all—is a fragmentary
inscription of the year 409-8 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, containing a few lines
written in the old Attic alphabet, which, though ‘restored’
in a manner sufficiently satisfactory to render it trustworthy
and intelligible, gives us nevertheless the most rudimentary
information about the Attic murder-code. The real value
of this inscription has been indicated by Lipsius.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The fragments
of laws which are found on the inscription are so closely
identical with the corresponding portions of the Draconian
laws as they are cited by Demosthenes that they must, he
says, be regarded as furnishing a convincing proof of the
validity of the remaining laws which Demosthenes has cited.
Now, these remaining laws are written in the Ionic alphabet,
which was used by Athenian writers in the fourth century
and in the latter half of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it so happens
that the date of the change in the alphabet used in Attic inscriptions,
namely, the year 403-2 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, was also the date of
what Glotz<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> describes as ‘la grande révision législative qui
signala l’archontat d’Euclide.’ If, then, any changes occurred
in Attic murder-law, in the period which elapsed between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Dracon and Eucleides, it was probably in the year 403-2 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
that such changes were finally incorporated in the written
code. We shall see that there is no reference to the Areopagus
in our fragment, but it may of course have been mentioned in
the missing portion of the inscription which referred to wilful
murder. Pollux and Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> state that the Areopagus was
created by Solon. We shall see later<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> what elements of truth
this dictum may contain. The only change which we believe
to have been made in the period from Dracon to Eucleides was
the isolation of the Areopagus from the general list of the
Ephetae courts.<a id="FNanchor_910b" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This change we attribute to Solon, and
with this exception we accept the murder-laws which are quoted
by Demosthenes as the original code of Dracon. We have
already<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> argued against the theory of Glotz that the clause
μηδ’ ἀποινᾶν was a Solonian innovation. The alteration
which we attribute to Solon was not properly speaking a change
in the murder-code, but merely a change in the distribution
of pleas in the judicial system. Hence we accept the ancient
tradition<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that ‘Solon changed all the laws of Dracon except
those relating to homicide.’ The Solonian legislation was less
severe and more humane than Dracon’s code. If Solon did
not alter the murder-laws, it was probably because they were,
so to speak, so non-Draconian, because they did not bear the
stamp of Dracon’s own peculiar genius. They were, we have
said,<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> an eclectic codification of the unwritten laws of the Ephetae
and the Exegetae. Religiously consecrated by their joint
tribal and Apolline inspiration, they stood above the gales of
Athenian political ferment. It was only in the personnel of the
judicial system that a loophole was left open for political intrigue.
In this respect alone was alteration easy and obvious: and in
this respect alone do we suppose that alterations took place.</p>

<p>The original inscription of 409-8 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> consists of forty-eight
lines, of which six are undecipherable, and nine others
badly mutilated. We will give here just four of the best lines,
from which the condition of the remainder may be inferred.</p>

<p>This inscription has been restored, mainly, from quotations
in the speeches of Demosthenes. But before attempting
to translate it, we must point out that even in its restored
form the inscription is archaic and obscure, and the meaning
is not always certain. The first half of the inscription seems
to refer to involuntary or accidental homicide. But the end
of the second line, as it stands, cannot possibly be taken to
refer to accidental homicide, because the verb βουλεύειν
usually means ‘to plot’ or ‘to resolve,’ and therefore implies
an element of deliberation. Wilful murder is not expressly
mentioned, save in so far as the slaying of a homicide exile
abroad is decreed to be equivalent to murder. There is also
a reference to justifiable homicide in self-defence. But most
of the fragment consists of an enumeration of the persons who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
are by law entitled to share in the acceptance of gifts of
‘appeasement’ from an involuntary slayer: and of the
judges by whom the various kinds of homicide must be decided.
We do not believe that any judicial distinction is intended
in the use of the two verbs δικάζειν and διαγιγνώσκειν.
Both words mean, we think, ‘to adjudicate.’ There is no
question of preliminary investigation as distinct from final
decision. In regard to the second line, the restoration ὡς
βουλεύσαντα can only mean ‘on the ground of having plotted
(to kill).’ Did the restorer mean by this clause ‘attempting
murder’ (when death did not ensue) or ‘contriving murder’
(when death did ensue)? The noun βούλευσις can have
both these meanings, but the verb βουλεύειν cannot, we
think, denote attempts to kill. If the restorer meant ‘contriving
murder,’ such an interpretation is open to the following
objections: (1) ‘contriving murder’ ranked with wilful
murder in Attic law, and was tried by the Areopagus, not by
the Ephetae<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>: (2) it is rightly maintained<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that the presence
of καί at the beginning of the inscription indicates that a
portion is missing, and it is natural to assume that this missing
portion contained the law relating to the graver kinds of
homicide, including not only wilful murder, but also contriving
murder. In order to obviate such objections, Philippi
abandons the verb βουλεύειν and proposes to read βουλεύσεως
τὸν ἀεὶ βασιλεύσαντα, ‘the King-archon for the time being
shall judge concerning attempted murder.’ But this suggestion
is open to the following objections: (1) we are compelled
to render διαγνῶναι (l. 13) ‘to adjudicate finally,’ and we
do not think that it bears this meaning in the inscription;
(2) τὸν ἀεὶ βασιλεύσαντα is a very questionable Greek
rendering for ‘he who is King-archon for the time being’:
(3) while it is true that attempted murder was tried, in
Aristotle’s time,<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the Palladium, it has no real affinity
with manslaughter. It is impossible to suppose that the
‘appeasement’ mentioned in the inscription could have
ever been applied in cases of attempted murder. It would
be absurd to compensate relatives who had lost nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
and to ignore the person on whose life the attempt was made.
Demosthenes definitely cites<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> this law of ‘appeasement’ as
referring to manslaughter. Hence, as we believe that the second
line of our inscription refers to manslaughter and as λευσαντα
(<i>sic</i>) is found in the unrestored part of the inscription, we propose
to restore μὴ βου]λεύσαντα instead of ὡς βου]λευσαντα and
understanding κτεῖναι with αἰτιᾶται, we translate ‘if anyone
accuses a person of slaying without deliberate resolve.’</p>

<p>We will now suggest a translation of this passage, reading
μή instead of ὡς in the second line.</p>

<p>‘And if a man slays a man not with intent (to kill), let
him be put on trial (φεύγειν), and let the “Kings” judge of
the causes of death, or, if anyone accuses a person of slaying
without deliberation (μὴ βουλεύσαντα), let the Ephetae adjudicate.
And the “appeasement,” if there is a father or
(and) brother(s) or (and) sons (of the slain), let all (accept)
or let one objector hold the field: if there be none of
these, let (the “appeasement” extend) to cousinship and
cousins, provided all consent to be “appeased” having
sworn the (customary) oath: if there be none of these
(<i>i.e.</i> cousins) and if the man slays involuntarily, and the
Fifty-one, the Ephetae, decide that he slew involuntarily,
let ten phrateres permit his return from exile,<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[13A]</a> if they (all)
agree, and let the Fifty-one select these (ten) according to
birth (or rank or merit—ἄριστίνδην), and let (all) previous
slayers be bound by this law: ... and if any person slays a
manslayer or causes (<i>i.e.</i> plots) his death while the manslayer
abstains from the boundary markets and from Amphictyonic
games and festivals, let him be liable to the same penalty
as if he had slain an Athenian (citizen): and let the Ephetae
judge the case: ... it is lawful to kill manslayers or to
arrest them, in our territory (ἡμεδαπῇ) but it is not lawful to
torture them or to amerce them: the fine payable shall be
twice the amercement: ... if any person slays on the spur
of the moment in self-defence a man who tries by violence
unjustly to rob and plunder him, let his act of bloodshed go
unpunished.’</p>

<p>Philippi<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> finds the reference to ‘the kings’ in this inscription
rather difficult to explain. He thinks that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
allusion can only be to archons, but he feels also that ‘it
seems inadmissible to assume collegiate functioning after the
archonship became annual.’ He therefore views with
sympathy the extraordinary suggestion of Köhler, that τὸς
βασιλέας means τοὺς ἀεὶ βασιλεύοντας, that ‘the kings’
are ‘those who from time to time held the office of king-archon.’
The solution of this, as of other difficulties in the inscription,
is, we believe, to be found in a correct analysis of the word
ἄκων, which means ‘involuntarily’ or without intent.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a man A caused the death of another
man B. Obviously this event could occur either (1) in an
accidental manner, without the least possible foresight or
culpable neglect, as for instance in a wrestling-match or in a
javelin-throwing competition: or (2) in circumstances which
implied a certain amount of culpable neglect, or ἀφυλαξία,
because the slayer did not take the usual or the necessary
precautions—as, for instance, if a drug was administered,
in illness, to B, and A did not see to it that the drug was of
the proper kind: or (3) in a manner which involved a certain
amount of intent or deliberation, though not necessarily
‘malice aforethought,’ on the part of the slayer, as, for instance,
if A struck B in a drunken bout, or in a sudden fit of anger,
jealousy or revenge. Plato,<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in the <i>Laws</i>, makes the clearest
possible distinction between these cases, and so does Antiphon<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
in his <i>Tetralogies</i>. But the Greek words ἄκων and ἀκούσιος
were applied indiscriminately to all three cases!</p>

<p>The Greeks of historical times actually put on trial
inanimate objects which had slain a man. Why? Was it
because these objects were regarded as polluted and it was
necessary to discover the extent of the pollution? We do
not think so, for such objects were either polluted or they were
not. There could have been no question of degrees of pollution.
The purpose of such a trial was rather, we think,
to inquire whether the objects were guilty or not. But why
was this question of such importance? Clearly because there
was a human, as distinct from a divine, interest in such trials.
We suggest that these trials were instituted primarily in order
to establish the innocence of an accused man. In Greek
law, unlike modern law, it was necessary for a man to prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
his innocence. He could only do this, very often, by proving
that somebody else, or something else, was guilty. We do
not agree with Müller<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and Philippi<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in regarding these
trials (δικαὶ ἀψύχων) as sham trials. Presided over by five
‘kings,’ as Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> assures us that they were, they cannot
have been so altogether meaningless and absurd. They were,
we think, almost as important as a modern Coroner’s inquest.
Now, who, we may ask, were the five ‘kings’ who sat at the
Prytaneum ‘murder’ court in the time of Aristotle? They
were, simply, the King-Archon, and the four Phylobasileis,
or Tribe-Kings, who still survived as the religious and judicial
representatives of the old Ionian tribes of Attica. These
kings are therefore the aristocratic descendants of the Elders
who ‘sat on smooth stones in a sacred circle,’ in the Pelasgian
Age.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Prytaneum, as Glotz<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> points out, was the oldest
court at Athens. Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> connects this court with the
worship of the ancestral-hearth; it was, he thinks, the divine
‘hearth-stone’ of the nation, the source of its vitality, the
symbol of its immortality. Yet this court Müller and Philippi
regard as a mock or sham-court, in which a number of respectable
but unintelligent nobles persisted in upholding the obsolete
traditions of a ridiculous past!</p>

<p>We believe that ‘the kings’ of the Prytaneum Court are
identical with ‘the kings’ of our Draconian inscription. The
first two lines of the fragment refer, in our view, to accidental
slaying, in which there was no degree of guilt attaching to the
human agent, but in which it was necessary to prove that the
guilt was attached to an animal or an inanimate object. We
think it quite probable that such cases were tried at the
Prytaneum.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We may go so far as to say that such cases
were the <i>raison d’être</i> of the survival and the historical importance
of such a court.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The legislator, in our inscription,
says: ‘If a man slays another without intent, let him be
put on trial, let “the kings” judge of the causes of death’
(δικάζειν αἰτιῶν φόνου).</p>

<p>We shall discuss<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> later the function of the Ephetae judges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
who are mentioned in this inscription as collaborating with
the kings in the judicial investigation of homicide-guilt, and
we shall suggest an explanation of the fact that they were
invariably fifty-one in number.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In regard to the adverb
ἄριστίνδην, which means, in general, ‘according to excellence,’
we agree with Philippi<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> that in the context it refers to birth
rather than to social rank. The selection of the phrateres
would probably have been made from ‘brethren’ who were
not kinsmen of the slayer, but merely related by ties of
‘affinity’ or of local contiguity with him. Plato<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> suggests
that in certain cases of homicide the judges of guilt (and
probably therefore of atonement) should not be akin to the
criminal. The fact that the father and the brothers (we assume
that the singular form ἀδελφός includes all the brothers)
and the sons of the slain could, if unanimous, have accepted
‘appeasement’ and have legalised the manslayer’s return from
exile, shows how far from, and yet how near to, the wergeld
customs of Pelasgian days were the historical murder laws of
Greece. Yet here we have not wergeld proper, but only a
survival, a reflection, of its ancient vigour. Nothing could
show more clearly than this law does the validity of our theory<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
which finds in a ‘compromise’ between different forces the
origin of the historical homicide-code of Greece.</p>

<p>Glotz<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> holds that the objection of a single relative to
‘appeasement’ could neutralise the will of the other kinsmen
because, if he were obdurate, he could prevent the unanimity
which was required by law for such return. But we shall
argue, later,<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that while the relatives had considerable legal
powers if they were unanimous, they were probably subject to
superior control if they disagreed. It is difficult to suppose
that one bitter enemy amongst the relatives of the slain could,
<i>in practice</i>, have imposed a penalty of perpetual exile for
manslaughter.</p>

<p>We have discussed<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the theory of Glotz that ‘private
settlement’ was legal, even for wilful murder. How can Glotz
reconcile such a theory with this Draconian law which provided
for<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a trial and a verdict even in cases of accidental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
slaying? According to our interpretation of the restored
inscription, the relatives of the slain may not always agree,
but the kings and the Ephetae must adjudicate in each case.</p>

<p>Glotz suggests,<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> further, that Dracon first introduced the
distinction between murder and manslaughter. Is this the
view which is suggested <i>prima facie</i> by the restored inscription?
To us it seems quite obvious that the inscription assumes, as
a familiar fact, an already existing distinction, not merely
between murder and manslaughter, but also between manslaughter
and accidental slaying. If the distinction appeared
as a legal innovation in the Draconian legislation, surely such
a distinction would have received some emphasis, since it would
have been necessary to enlighten an uncivilised public opinion;
surely the definitions of the various kinds of homicide would
have been more clearly marked and the penalties more clearly
indicated.</p>

<p>Since the Draconian inscription has been restored from
quotations in Demosthenic speeches, we shall turn to those
speeches for a more complete account of Attic homicide law.
But the Demosthenic references must be supplemented from
other sources—especially from Plato’s penal code.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Homicide Laws in Plato and Demosthenes</span></h4>

<p>If we accept the opinion of Coulanges<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that the synoekism
of Attica did not abolish the local prytanies and magistracies,
it will be readily conceded that the Athenian city courts,
that is, the Attic State courts, did not necessarily adjudicate
in all cases of homicide. Owing to the civic and religious
aspect of wilful murder and kin-slaying—crimes which involved
the penalty of death or the confiscation of property—we may
feel certain that the State courts had exclusive jurisdiction in
such cases.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But we cannot be sure that the same principle
applied to manslaughter and minor degrees of guilt, except
when such deeds occurred between parties who had only one
civic bond between them, namely, the political union of the
State. Most frequently, we admit, the parties involved would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
be of such a kind. The rise of political democracy and of a
new nobility of wealth led to the accumulation, in the cities
of Attica, of a vast multitude of persons who did not belong
to any of the old tribes or religious corporations.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The
common worship of the clan, the phratry and the tribe did
not receive their allegiance. Hence, probably, the courts of
such organisations would not, even if they could, adjudicate
in their case. But there survived in Attica, all through the
historical era, families who still belonged to these more primitive
groups. They were the old nobility, the country gentry,
scattered over rural Attica,<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> who continued to obey and,
where possible, to exercise the old jurisdictions of the clan,
the phratry, and the tribe. We have shown that local tribal
courts still functioned, with State-sanction, in historical
Attica.<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> We have quoted a passage<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> from Plato which
suggests that some such local courts had power to condemn
to death a person who maliciously wounded one of his parents.</p>

<p>We agree with Müller<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and Coulanges,<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in opposition to
Glotz<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and Philippi,<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in the view that Plato’s <i>Laws</i> are
based, in the main, upon the Attic legal codes. There are
certain points in which Platonic law seems independent of
Attic law. Are these variations to be attributed to the fancy
of an idealist or are they rather a supplement, an incorporation
of local and tribal laws which the State codes did not
mention but always presupposed? So far as homicide at
least is concerned, we prefer the second alternative: and
we shall give at a later stage the reasons for our preference.</p>

<p>In describing the trial of inanimate objects and of animals
which were guilty of human bloodshed, Plato says<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>: ‘If a
beast of burden or any other animal shall kill any person
(except in a public contest) let the relatives (of the deceased)
prosecute the cause of death: and let the wardens of rural
areas (ἀγρόνομοι) upon whom ... the relatives shall impose
this task, decide upon the matter: and let them destroy the
animal (if) condemned and cast it beyond the boundaries
(of the State). If any inanimate object deprives a person of
life (except lightning or such god-sent bolt ...) either by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the person falling upon it or by its falling upon the person,
let the nearest of kin appoint the nearest neighbour to act
as judge, and (thus) free from pollution himself and his whole
kindred, and cast the condemned object beyond the boundaries.’
There is no mention of the Prytaneum Court or of
the Tribe-Kings. We can explain the omission by supposing
that Plato is referring to local courts and local cases of bloodshed,
in which the relatives had not to go outside their immediate
neighbourhood to obtain jurisdiction. The ancient
phratry was an assembly of local clans: neighbourhood was
the essential factor in the bond which the phratry religion
represented. The ‘nearest neighbour’ in this quotation would
have been a member of the phratry, if not of the clan, to which
the slain person belonged. The duty of prosecution which is
here referred to was no sham duty<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; it was a serious religious
obligation. Failure to prosecute would have ‘polluted’ the
relatives of the slain.</p>

<p>So far there is no question of any human guilt. But
such a question might have easily arisen. In the Hebrew
murder-code,<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> if an ox gored a man to death, it was necessary
to inquire whether the ox had been ‘let out’ by the owner,
and whether the ox was previously ‘known to be dangerous.’
If so, the owner could have been put to death, unless he ransomed
his life. Let us suppose, furthermore, that the object
had not ‘fallen,’ but was such that it must have been ‘thrown.’
Two cases might now arise: (1) the ‘thrower’ might confess
that he threw the object, say, a stone or a piece of wood, but
at the same time deny that he threw it with the intention of
hitting, much less, of killing, any person: or (2) the ‘thrower,’
guilty of intent to kill, might escape undetected, perhaps
concealed by a wall or a boulder or a shrubbery, from which
he had hurled the fatal missile. Thus, the trial of inanimate
objects, and also, but to a less extent, the trial of animals,
might have had a close connexion on the one hand with the
question of accidental homicide, committed by a human agent,
and on the other with the question of ‘murder by persons
unknown.’ Upon the precise circumstances of each case
would have depended the question whether local magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
and tribunals would have possessed jurisdiction in the matter,
or whether it would have had to be referred to the central
State authority at Athens. But to this same authority would
naturally also have fallen the decision as to the guilt of
animals or objects which had caused the loss of human life
within the city of Athens and its environs: and hence we can
understand why the central Prytaneum court had to adjudicate
not only upon guilty animals and inanimate objects, but also,
and with much more serious possibilities, upon murder by
persons unknown.</p>

<p>In the case of objects which could only have proved fatal
if they were thrown by a human agent, a verdict of acquittal,
in regard to such objects, would have logically involved a
verdict of murder by persons unknown; for, if we suppose
that the object was accidentally thrown, it is probable that
the thrower would have come forward and established the
blood-guilt of the object concurrently with his own innocence.
Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> says in regard to the Prytaneum court: ‘If
a stone or piece of wood or iron or anything of the kind falls
upon and strikes a man and we are ignorant who it was that
threw it, but know and have in our possession the instrument
of death, proceedings are taken against such instruments here.’
Plato asserts that the objects mentioned were prosecuted by
the relatives of the slain: but may we not also assume that
a man who had thrown one of these objects without malicious
intent, and who was accused of murder or manslaughter,
would have lodged an accusation against the ‘object’ at the
preliminary inquiry<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> before the King-Archon, that is, at the
Prytaneum? If the Prytaneum found the object guilty,
would not the verdict have prohibited any further proceedings?
If, on the other hand, the object was clearly hurled by a human
agent with malicious intent, and if the agent was unknown,
proceedings, of a most formal kind, were taken against the
unknown slayer.</p>

<p>Similar proceedings would of course be taken if there
was no ‘object’ involved, as, for instance, in case of death by
strangling. Such proceedings are thus described by Plato<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>:
‘If anyone,’ he says, ‘is found dead and the murderer is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
known, and is not discovered by careful search-parties, let
there be proclamation against the murderer as in other cases,
and let the heir-at-law (<i>i.e.</i> the nearest relative of the deceased)
proclaim in the market-place that the murderer, whoever he
is, must not, since he is guilty of bloodshed, set foot in any
sacred place in his native State or in that of his victim, or if
he does, and he is discovered and identified, he shall be put
to death and cast unburied beyond the boundaries.’ We have
already pointed out<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that the object and purpose of trials
for homicide in Greece was not so much the establishment of
guilt, as it is in modern States, but rather the establishment
of innocence. Now, our last quotation from Plato suggests
that a man who came to be suspected of homicide some time
after the crime was committed, and who was never formally
prosecuted and convicted, could, nevertheless, be put to death!
But we shall see<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that one refuge still remained to the ‘unfortunate
wretch.’ He could have pleaded innocence, in the
presence of the avengers, and this plea compelled <i>ipso facto</i>
a recourse to trial: he could of course be arrested on the spot
and imprisoned, but he could challenge a verdict at a court
of summary jurisdiction, the prison court, known as ‘the
Eleven,’<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and if he proved his innocence to the satisfaction
of more than four-fifths of his judges, his accuser paid a fine
of one thousand drachmae! Thus, he could not be slain on
the spot by the avengers if he pleaded innocence: but unless he
proved that he was innocent he was ultimately put to death.</p>

<p>Aristotle may be taken to suggest that there was no essential
connexion between the trial of inanimate objects and the
verdict of murder against a person unknown. He says<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>:
‘if the name of the homicide is unknown, the indictment is
prosecuted in general terms against the unknown author’; but
in the next line he adds: ‘The King-Archon and the Tribe-Kings
have competence in indictments against lifeless objects and
the brute creation.’ The juxtaposition of such references is
sufficiently significant. Pollux<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> is more definite: ‘The Prytaneum
court,’ he says, ‘adjudicates concerning slayers if they
are unknown, and also concerning lifeless objects that have
fallen and caused death.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Though none of these authorities say anything to support,
neither do they say anything which refutes, our opinion that
the Prytaneum court could also try cases of ‘accidental’
slaying in which a person accused of manslaughter pleaded an
entire absence of neglect<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> or passion or intent. Our view is
however rendered probable by the fact that preliminary inquiries
in homicide cases were made in this place which, in
addition to being a court, was also the official residence of the
King-Archon and of the Prytaneis<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; but the most cogent
argument in favour of our hypothesis is to be found in the
first two lines of the Draconian inscription if our interpretation
of these lines is correct. We fail to see how the Draconian
reference to ‘kings’ as ‘the judges’ in cases of homicide
committed ‘without intent’<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> can be otherwise satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p>If it be objected that pleas of ‘accidental’ homicide were
regularly tried at the Palladium court,<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> we may reply that the
proper function of this court was subsidiary or supplemental
to that of the Prytaneum. In the Palladium the accused in
his plea denied, indeed, any guilt, but he would have found it
difficult to prove his innocence unless he could transfer the
guilt to another person. In the Prytaneum, as we conceive
it, he had often an opportunity of laying the blame upon an
inanimate instrument of death. Such a plea of accidental
slaying involved no question of human guilt, as the accusation
was centred upon an inanimate ‘object.’ Again, whenever
the plea of the accused differed from the charge of the
accuser, it was the duty of the King-Archon to decide on the
probabilities of the case, before he relegated the trial to its
appropriate court.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> If, then, a person accused of murder
or manslaughter could advance a plea of accidental homicide
by accusing an inanimate object, the Prytaneum court adjoining
the official residence of the King and the Prytaneis
would have been at the immediate disposal of the defendant.
No long period of time, such as ordinarily had to elapse between
formal accusations and homicide trials, preceded the trials
at the Prytaneum; and we may infer from Plato’s account
that the verdict of ‘death by persons unknown’ was normally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
brought in by the Prytaneum court before any formal proclamation
of the unknown murderer was made by the relatives
of the slain.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Involuntary Homicide</span></h4>

<p>In regard to pleas and charges of manslaughter, we hope
to show that there is a very substantial agreement amongst
the ancient authorities. Once more<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> we must call attention
to the possibility of local as distinct from central jurisdiction.
Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> quotes a law of Dracon relating to the ‘appeasement’
of the relatives of the slain, which is practically identical
with the law which we have quoted from the restored inscription.
‘Proclamation to (or against) the slayer shall be made
in the market-place (by all relatives of deceased) within the
degrees of cousinship and by cousins; in the prosecution there
shall act jointly with these, the sons of cousins, the sons-in-law
(γαμβρούς) and the fathers-in-law (πενθερούς), the cousins-in-law,
the sons of such cousins and the phrateres. If “appeasement”
is prescribed (δέῃ), if there is a father or (and)
brother(s) or (and) sons, let all (these) be appeased or let one
objector hold the field: if there are none of these, and (the
accused) slays involuntarily, and the Fifty-one, the Ephetae,
decide that he slew involuntarily, let ten phrateres decide
about appeasement, if (all) consent. These let the Fifty-one
choose according to birth (or merit).’ We give below<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the
Greek version of the latter portion of the law, so that it may be
the more easily compared with the corresponding portion of
the Draconian inscription. In this inscription, there are two
lines which are not found in Demosthenes, namely those which
refer to the rôle of the ‘cousins’ in accepting ‘appeasement.’
We must not, however, conclude that the cousins had ceased
to have a voice in ‘appeasement’ in the time of Demosthenes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
or from the year 403/2 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards, or in Solon’s time. We
are convinced that the omission is due either to the negligence
of a scribe or to the deliberate excision by Demosthenes of
unnecessary elements of law in a legal quotation which included
extracts from different laws, most of which are only remotely
relevant to his main purpose in the speech. It would be
absurd to suppose that a legal innovator jumped from the
‘small family’ to the neighbour-brethren (phrateres) and
ignored the cousins in an enactment involving the transfer
of property which constituted ‘appeasement.’ Surely if any
change were made in the personnel of the recipients, the
‘neighbours’ would have been first omitted. And we cannot
suppose that cousins had become obsolete since Dracon’s
time!</p>

<p>The formal proclamation of a charge of manslaughter
against the accused was the initial act of the ‘prosecution’
which, after a period of inquiry, after examination of witnesses,
and after various other formalities, ultimately culminated in
the formal trial of the accused at the Palladium court. But,
as it stands, this quotation from Demosthenes suggests, <i>prima
facie</i>, that trial could be dispensed with if the deceased had
near relations who unanimously consented to accept ‘appeasement’:
and that it was only in the absence of relatives that a
trial took place, after which the phrateres, who were merely
neighbours, negotiated the appeasement. But this <i>prima facie</i>
inference arises from the clumsy and unscientific wording of
the law. That the inference is logically invalid is obvious
from the simple fact that, in the absence of relatives of the
deceased, the slayer could not be tried at all! When the law
says ‘if there are none of these,’ it must be taken to mean
‘if none of the groups which are privileged to decide about
appeasement can be brought to unanimity.’</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary thing, that in this Demosthenic
citation of the law relating to manslaughter there is no <i>certain</i>
reference to the penalty of exile. Are we to assume that such
a penalty was not legally compulsory, that it was merely a
fortuitous eventuality which depended entirely on the attitude
of the relatives to ‘appeasement’? Are we to suppose that if
all the relatives concerned agreed to be ‘appeased’ immediately
after the trial and the verdict, the manslayer could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
remained at home precisely as in the old wergeld days? We
have no doubt that so far as the relatives of the slain were
concerned, he could have remained at home. But could he
have been admitted to purgation? Was he not ‘polluted’
if the dying man did not ‘release’ him? Could he have
ignored the anger of the gods and of the slain? The laws of
Dracon do not directly assist us in answering these questions:
on the contrary, by their obscure wording they suggest frequently
the wrong answer. But we have seen<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that these laws
can only be explained as a ‘compromise.’ In the wergeld
system of tribal Greek societies in pre-historic days, there
was a regular and scientific method of ‘appeasement’ which,
in most kinds of homicide, was recognised as a solvent of the
feud. But in the Draconian code ‘appeasement’ appears in
a degenerate and insignificant aspect. It is subordinated to
other penalties which are not stated with any degree of emphasis,
for the simple reason that they were universally familiar. All
the arguments which we have put forward in support of our
theory of a ‘compromise’ in Attic law compel us to assume
that exile was an essential ingredient of the penalty for manslaughter.
Such an assumption is implied in the reading ἐσέσθων
(let them permit to return) occurring in the Draconian inscription.
Demosthenes, unfortunately, has αἰδεσάσθων, which
refers merely to ‘appeasement.’ As we should have expected,
Glotz<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and Müller<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> interpret this Demosthenic reference as if
it were a logical scientific document: and they accept the <i>prima
facie</i> inference that a person accused of manslaughter could,
as soon as he was publicly proclaimed and banned from all
public and religious intercourse, avoid the ordeal of a trial and
the punishment of exile by simply taking some money with
him to the house of the father, brother and sons of deceased;
if he succeeded in securing a ‘settlement’ and procured a ‘legal
release,’ he could have quietly resumed his ordinary occupations!
This interpretation, which we have already rejected,<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
is inconsistent with other passages in Demosthenes and in
Plato which we shall now discuss. While we admit that this law
of Dracon does not, unfortunately, mention the exile penalty
for manslaughter as an obvious and incontrovertible fact, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
we insist that it does mention trial as a normal concomitant.
The Ephetae are there, first and last. The Ephetae must decide
the degree of guilt: they must decide that the slayer slew
involuntarily: they must in the absence of relatives or in the
event of their disagreement select the ‘phrateres’ according
to birth or merit. This at least is very different from ‘private
settlement.’</p>

<p>Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> quotes another law of Dracon regarding
manslaughter, as follows: ‘If anyone shall pursue or plunder
beyond the civic boundary any of those slayers who have
gone into exile and whose property is not confiscate to the
State, he shall incur the same penalty as if he did so inside
our boundaries’ (ἐν τῇ ἡμεδαπῇ). Fortunately we possess
Demosthenes’ explanation of this law which, because of its
peculiar expression, requires some such explanation. The
word ἐπίτιμα, in reference to property, is opposed to ἄτιμα
and means ‘not confiscated.’ Hence, the phrase ‘Slayers
whose property is not confiscated’ must refer, says the orator,
to ‘involuntary slayers,’ because the property of wilful
murderers is confiscated to the State. Thus this Draconian
law, instead of employing the adjective ‘involuntary’ (ἀκούσιος)
as a predicate of ‘slayers,’ uses two clauses to describe what
a single adjective would have described. Are these two
clauses, then, to be regarded as definitive; as concerned with
qualities which normally and universally characterised involuntary
slayers? Are involuntary homicides, as a class,
defined as ‘those manslayers who have gone into exile and
whose property is State-guaranteed’ (ἐπίτιμα)? Or are we
rather to suppose that there were two classes of involuntary
homicides, and that this law refers to only one of these classes—that
in some cases, as Glotz and Müller conceive the matter,
the slayer bribed the relatives of the slain, and avoided all
further trouble; and, in other cases, he went into exile? In
our opinion this quotation suggests that all involuntary slayers
went into exile for a period of time. Müller holds<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> that the
duration of this period of exile was not fixed by any law:
that the slayer remained in exile until such time as the relatives
accepted ‘appeasement.’ We shall discuss this opinion more
fully later, but we may say here that it seems very strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
that the State should have guaranteed protection for the
property of the slayer, and should, at the same time, have
had no voice in determining the limits of his period of exile,
no influence in constraining the relatives of the slain to accept
‘appeasement.’</p>

<p>Speaking of involuntary homicide, in another passage,
Demosthenes says<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>: ‘If the accused be convicted and be
found to have done the deed, neither the prosecutor nor anyone
else has control over him, but the law alone. And what
does the law command? That a person convicted of involuntary
homicide shall on certain stated days leave the country
by an appointed road and remain in exile until he has appeased
certain<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of the relatives of the slain (τινα τῶν ἐν γένει τοῦ
πεπονθότος): then it permits him to return, not anyhow, but
in a particular manner, ordering him to sacrifice and be
“purged” and giving other directions which he must carry
out. Rightly, men of Athens, does the law prescribe all this.
It is just to make the penalty of involuntary homicide less
than voluntary, and it is right to prescribe exile guaranteeing
(a person) a secure exodus, and for the returning exile to free
himself from tabu and be cleansed by customary rites; above
all it is right that the laws should control everybody and
everything.’ In this passage we find the usual obscurity of
language and even apparent discrepancies.</p>

<p>Is it suggested that if the manslayer is not accused and
convicted, the law has no control over him? Glotz and
Müller would find in such quotations a proof of their theory
of the legality of ‘private settlement.’ But it is absurd to
examine as it were microscopically such passages as this. They
must be interpreted, as far as possible, in the light of other
parallel references, and accepted or rejected according to the
criterion of consistency. We admit of course that Demosthenes
is not always consistent; he was essentially an orator, and as
an orator he placed rhetoric before logic, persuasion before
truth. But in legal quotations he had to respect the legal
knowledge of his audience. Hence such quotations contain
of necessity an important element of truth. In the passage
which we have just cited there is an apparent discrepancy
which militates somewhat against its logical value. We may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
ask: ‘How can the law be said to be master of everybody
and everything if it guarantees to the relatives of the slain
the right to refuse “appeasement,” even if there be only one
dissentient?’ A law of Dracon prescribed that ‘all must
agree or let one objector hold the field.’ Was not this objector,
then, κύριος τοῦ ἀνδροφόνου? What control had the law
over such an objector? On the very face of it, therefore,
this statement of Demosthenes seems inconsistent with itself!
But perhaps Plato will help us to solve the problem.</p>

<p>We have already<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> quoted Plato’s account of the penalty
for manslaughter. The legend, which he mentions, ‘of priests
of old’ concerning the temporary anger of the dead shows
the religious significance which the exile penalty possessed for
Plato: he understood the meaning of the ‘customary rites’
of cleansing and purgation which the manslayer had to perform
on his return. In his penal code, Plato differentiates between
different degrees of guilt in involuntary homicide: and it is
significant that the penalties vary correspondingly—not in the
extent of the ‘appeasement,’ but in the duration of the period
of exile. Thus he says<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>: ‘If anyone kills a freeman in a
passion, let him be of necessity an exile for two years.’ In
this case there is an element of guilt, but there is no deliberation
or intent to kill. He goes on to say: ‘He who in a passion
but with a certain degree of intent (μετ’ ἐπιβουλῆς) slays a
person, ... let him be an exile for three years ... being
punished during a longer period because of the greater seriousness
of his passion.’ ‘It is difficult,’ he continues, ‘to give
laws on such matters with accuracy. Of all such matters,
therefore, it is right for the guardians of the laws to have
cognisance: and when the period of the exile shall have
expired for each offender, it is right to send twelve judges
to the civic boundaries who having considered still more
clearly meanwhile the condition (or conduct—πραξεῖς) of the
exiles, will be the final arbiters (δικαστάς) of the “appeasement”
and their return home from exile: and let them abide
by the decisions of these magistrates; and if, after returning
from exile, anyone of these commits again the same offence,
let him be exiled and never return: if he returns let him suffer
in the same way as if a stranger returns’ (κατὰ τὴν τοῦ ξένου<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
ἄφιξιν). Here we have a very different picture from that
which the theories of Glotz and Müller and some Demosthenic
passages suggest. There is question of manslaughter, but
there is no reference to the power of wrangling relatives to
prevent the exile’s return. On the contrary, it is stated that
the ‘appeasement’ was controlled by judges who may have
been <i>phrateres</i>, but were probably not kinsmen of the slayer.
The last line in the passage refers to a law which we have
already<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> mentioned, namely that which decreed perpetual
exile for manslaughter committed between strangers in any
given State. The penalty for ‘returning’ in such a case, that
is, for <i>rupture de ban</i>, was death.</p>

<p>In a passage which refers to a case of kin-slaying, in which
the dying man ‘forgave’ his slayer (without, however, granting
a ‘release’), Plato says<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>: ‘If any person of his own
accord absolves anyone for such a deed, let the purgations be
made for the slayer as if his act had been involuntary, and let
one year be the term of his absence from the country according
to law.’ The theory of the legality of ‘private settlement,’
before or after trial, cannot be reconciled with this quotation.
The phrase ‘according to law’ suggests that Plato refers
to actual Attic law, and not to an ideal law of his own
creation.</p>

<p>Plato adds that in such a case the slayer can never resume
his ordinary domestic life, even though he recovers his civic
status. Similarly, for the slaying in a passion of a husband
by his wife, or of a wife by her husband, the penalty prescribed
is three years’ exile, but such persons, even though not akin
in blood, cannot return home to share in common domestic
rites with their children, or to eat at the same table. In this
law we see clearly the operation of a local or domestic ‘pollution’
which debars the slayer from his family hearth, and which
is quite distinct from the civic pollution which debars him
from certain definite States. It is important to observe that
with the local or domestic pollution no civic or international
law has ever interfered; whereas civic pollution has been
regulated by law according to the varying degrees of guilt,
and the claims of the relatives to ‘appeasement.’</p>

<p>Plato implies that one year was the normal period of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
exile for manslaughter. The Greek verbs ἀπενιαυτίζειν<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and ἀπενιαυτεῖν convey the same implication. Can this fact
be reconciled with the law of Dracon? We believe that it
can, but only by distinguishing between theory and practice,
between local and central courts, between local and central
religion.</p>

<p>Plato shows how local judges would have solved the
difficulty caused by recalcitrant relatives. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
that Plato decrees perpetual exile for manslaughter between
strangers. But exile from what State? Surely it was only
from the State in which the deed took place: and the reason
for this penalty was probably the fact that the relatives of the
slain did not live in the State where the deed took place:
and hence no ‘appeasement’ of these relatives could formally
admit him to that State, though he could be admitted through
‘appeasement’ to his native State, if the slayer and the slain
were both citizens of the same State. Thus the tendency of
the pollution doctrine, apart from the claims of the relatives
of the slain, was to exact perpetual exile for manslaughter.
Plato decrees that any citizen had the right to prosecute a
stranger for manslaughter, but not that he had a right to
accept ‘appeasement.’<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Hence, by a strange paradox, the
relatives of the slain provided a medium by which the man-slayer
regained his civic status. Yet, in the case of involuntary
kin-slaying, the slayer could never re-enter his home! We
believe that these decrees are not Platonic creations, but were
found in Attic law, written or unwritten. Can they be
reconciled and made intelligible?</p>

<p>We saw<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that wergeld was not admissible for kin-slaying
in the Pelasgian tribal system. Outside the kindred, however,
wergeld permitted the slayer to remain at home or to
return after a time, if he could not pay the full <i>were</i>. A
comparison of such customs with the historical homicide code
suggests quite obviously a compromise, in which the seventh-century
pollution-doctrine failed to impose its will on the relatives
of the victim because of a real or presumed ‘forgiveness’
on the part of the slain. Without the anger of the dead, the
pollution doctrine could not operate.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Apollo himself could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
not enforce it. The relatives of the slain had a just claim to
be regarded as the best interpreters of the anger of the dead.
It was in this crevice, so to speak, in the doctrine of pollution
that the kindred of the slain drove the thin end of their old
tribal wedge. They claimed the right to determine the period
of exile for manslaughter, but for manslaughter only: for in
such cases the anger of the dead could not be regarded as
perpetually implacable. In theory, then, these relatives had
the right to consent to ‘appeasement’ at any time; but in
deference to the dead their consent could not become effective
before a year had passed. They could in theory delay their
consent indefinitely, but delay was less probable in local than in
central jurisdiction. They were compelled by law to prosecute
the manslayer in court if the slayer denied his guilt; but if
he admitted guilt, no trial was necessary; and it was only in
such a contingency that ‘appeasement’ could occur without
trial: nevertheless a year’s exile was still necessary before the
relatives could accept ‘appeasement’ and finally remove the
barriers to ‘purgation.’ The fact that the involuntary kin-slayer
could never re-enter his home we attribute to the
tradition of Pelasgian domestic religion.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This solution reconciles,
we think, the law of Dracon, the code of Plato, and
most of Demosthenes’ references. It is also in harmony with
our general theory<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> of the compromise between ‘pollution,’
tribal wergeld, and State law, which is expressed in the murder-code
of historical Greece.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Justifiable and Justifiably Accidental Homicide</span></h4>

<p>In our analysis of the Attic laws concerning justifiable
homicide, we will begin by drawing a distinction between
three possible contingencies. First of all, we can conceive
that blood has been shed without any intent to kill, but
with a certain element of neglect (ἀφυλαξία), which has however
been expressly mentioned and declared to be justifiable in
law. Secondly, we may suppose that there was a certain
degree of intent to kill and a certain amount of deliberation,
but also that there was an extenuating element of impulse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
or passion which has been decreed guiltless, in certain circumstances,
by the law. Thirdly, we may suppose that the
person slain was an outlaw or a State-criminal, whose life
was forfeit by the laws of the land, and whose citizen-slayer
was declared to be justified in advance.</p>

<p>Homicide of the first class has so much in common with
ordinary accidental homicide that we think it probable that
they were often confused in Greek thought, if not in law.
The words ἄκων and ἀκούσιος which, we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> were
applied indiscriminately to denote cases of different degrees
of guilt in accidental slaying and in manslaughter, were also
used to denote such forms of accidental slaying as were
expressly ‘justified’ by law. Perhaps this confusion may
help to explain still further the apparent discrepancies in
Demosthenic references to ‘release’ and ‘private settlement.’
For the case which we are now discussing, there was no penalty,
no exile, or loss of property, not even a fine. Pleas of justifiably
accidental homicide were doubtless frequently made in
answer to charges of manslaughter or of wilful murder. The
King-Archon (and perhaps also the Tribe Kings) had to decide
between the merits of the ‘charge’ and of the ‘plea.’
Obviously, it was always as a result of a ‘plea,’ never as a
result of a ‘charge,’ that homicide cases were referred to the
Delphinium court.</p>

<p>Justifiable homicide of the second class has close affinities
with extenuated manslaughter, or slaying in a passion. The
essential difference lies in an express legal justification in one
case, and the absence of such a justification in the other.
When we come to analyse the Oresteian legends of Attic
tragedy we shall find<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that the close affinity which exists
between these two legal conceptions caused considerable confusion
in the legends—caused Orestes to be immune from
punishment, from one standpoint, but liable to a period of
exile, from another. The oracle of Apollo, which commanded
him to slay his mother, should naturally have been accepted
as a complete justification. Some legends took this view.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
But such a contingency was not expressly mentioned in the
Attic laws concerning justifiable homicide. Plato assures us<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
that under no circumstances, not even in self-defence, was it
lawful to slay a parent. Hence it became necessary to regard
Apollo as the divinely immune cause of guilt; and Orestes,
as his blind, obedient instrument, became liable to a merely
nominal charge of manslaughter or extenuated matricide!
His mother was almost compelled to ‘forgive’ the deed!
In one legend<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Apollo commanded the Erinnyes to withdraw
from pursuit, and drove them from his temple; in another he
decreed that they should pursue Orestes for a year!<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Our third classification includes cases in which only two
issues could be raised—namely, lawful homicide or wilful
murder. From this point of view the act of Orestes could
also be discussed, and an Athenian court could find it interesting
to discuss and difficult to decide at what precise time in
the post-Homeric social evolution did private vengeance
become illegal! The trial of Orestes at Argos, which Euripides
describes in the <i>Orestes</i>, seems to depend upon this legal
difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We will now illustrate these cases by relevant quotations.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> account is a mere extract, or rather a kind
of summary: ‘Homicide,’ he says, ‘admitted and alleged to
be lawful, as of an adulterer caught in the act, or of a friend
mistaken for an enemy in war, or of an antagonist in an
athletic contest, is tried in the Delphinium.’ The first clause
has been included in our second classification, the rest of the
cases belong to our first category. Demosthenes quotes<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the
Draconian laws, and his account is almost identical with that
which Plato<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> gives. To facilitate comparison, we will quote
both accounts together in parallel columns:</p>

</tr>

</table>

<p>We have elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> cited a Delphic law which concerned
justifiable slaying, and which, in its completeness, we regard
as the common parent of both these legislations. These
excerpts are strikingly similar, especially if we remember that
they are a number of extracts which we have put together
with the object of eliciting a complete list of cases. No better
proof than this could be adduced of the ‘historicity’ of
Platonic legislation<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> regarding homicide. Antiphon<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> refers
to the legal immunity of physicians, and we may therefore consider
this Platonic law to be also Draconian (or Solonian).<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>To both the above quotations our triple classification of
cases of justifiable homicide can without difficulty be applied.
Confining our attention to the Demosthenic account, we
may point out that the reference to accidental slaying in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
contest, ambush, or battle, is covered by our first category:
the infliction of death for adultery or seduction is included
in our second category: and the slaying of unjust aggressors,
and of murderers <i>en rupture de ban</i>, in our third category.</p>

<p>In regard to adultery, we have already<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> suggested that
the right to kill <i>in flagrante delicto</i> must not be regarded as
a relic of a primeval custom which decreed the death penalty
for adulterers in all circumstances. The Gortyn laws and the
Homeric customs which are denoted by the word μοιχάγρια
support our view that the right to kill <i>in flagrante delicto</i> was
an innovation of the period of synoekism and of centralised
government. Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> thinks that there is a strong probability
of correctness in Pausanias’ view<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> that the age of
Theseus represents the point at which the distinction of
justifiable homicide could be applied in such matters. But
our reading of Pausanias suggests that in his view the distinction
was first applied to adultery in the time of Dracon.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
We believe the distinction, thus applied, was as late as the
seventh century, and we agree with Pausanias that the penalty
thus decreed was severe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wilful Murder</span></h4>

<p>We have seen that the restored Draconian inscription
contains no reference to wilful murder. Demosthenes quotes
a law which merely mentions the crime and which is mainly
concerned with the allocation of trials for wilful murder to the
Areopagus court which normally had jurisdiction in such
cases. We shall discuss this law when we come to describe
the Athenian homicide courts. The actual penalties for
murder can only be inferred from the wording of other
Draconian laws, and from other sources, such as Plato. Thus
we may infer from the law<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which declared inviolable the
person and property of involuntary slayers, who are described
as ‘those who have gone into exile and whose property is
not confiscate,’ that in the graver kinds of homicide, such as
murder, the criminal’s property was confiscated to the State.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Again, from the law<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which forbade the slaying of a murderer
‘whilst he keeps away from the markets on State-boundaries
and from public games and Amphictyonic festivals,’ and from
the further law<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> which permitted the slaying of a murderer
found, after conviction, in his native territory, we may infer
that death was the normal penalty for any murderer who
did not go into perpetual exile. Demosthenes, in the speech
<i>against Meidias</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> says that ‘the laws punish those who have
slain with intent by death <i>or</i> (καί) perpetual exile <i>and</i> (καί)
confiscation of property.’ Plato<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> is quite lucid in his account
of wilful murder, but he omits to mention confiscation of
property. ‘Whoever,’ he says, ‘deliberately and unjustly
shall kill with his own hand any of his fellow citizens (τῶν
ἐμφυλίων), let him be debarred from civic and religious
privileges (τὰ νόμιμα) and let him not “pollute” the temples
or ports or other public meeting-place ... let him who is convicted
pay the penalty of death and let him not be buried in
the native land of the slain [or in his own, if that is different]:
but if he goes into exile without wishing to challenge a verdict
(κρίσιν ὑποσχεῖν) let him remain in perpetual exile.’ Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
implies that the last moment at which the murderer
could flee was ‘after the first speech’ at the trial.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
clearly means to say the same thing, though the omission of
the tiny negative μή has annoyed the commentators.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> ‘The
Areopagus,’ he says, ‘judged cases of slaying and wounding
with intent (to kill) and arson (with intent to kill?) and (the
administering of) drugs if one intends to kill in administering
(them).’ So far his words are identical with those of the
‘Draconian’ law, as it is given by Demosthenes. He continues:
‘There took place a preliminary oath (διωμοσία),
and after this the trial ... and after the first speech it was
lawful (for the defendant) to go into exile if anyone had slain
his parents’ (εἴ τις γονέας εἴη ἀπεκτονώς). When we
discuss presently<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the Attic law of parricide and kin-slaying,
it will perhaps be more obvious that Pollux must have written
εἰ μή τις γονέας εἴη ἀπεκτονώς, ‘<i>unless</i> a man had slain his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
parents.’ The ‘Draconian’ law concerning the Areopagus
will be discussed later, in our chapter on the Attic murder
courts. We need not enter into the details of the preliminary
accusations, the investigation before the Archon Basileus, and
the three monthly trials which preceded the final trial and the
verdict. Such details, if not already referred to, may be found
in all the ordinary books of reference.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> But there is one
question which merits a brief examination at this stage:
namely, the question whether the death penalty, in cases of
wilful murder, cancelled or obviated the confiscation of the
murderer’s property to the State.</p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> that in the wergeld system of the
tribes, the death of the slayer generally affected the payment
of wergeld, though custom seems to have varied between
the cancellation of the whole wergeld and the cancellation
of the murderer’s share. But we do not think, as Glotz
appears to think, that confiscation took the place of wergeld.
The purgation-rites for homicide, says Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> caused the
creation of sanctuaries and gave to the gods their share of
the ποινή. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> that in tribal societies which
practise wergeld there was a <i>saraad</i> or honour-price, quite
distinct from the <i>galanas</i> or wergeld proper, and it was
this honour-price which we consider to have been the indirect
source of the later penalty of confiscation. In the
evolution of strong central civic government, or of theocratic
power, this element could have been, and usually was, retained,
when wergeld was abolished. But ‘honour-price’ rarely
amounted to the total property of the offender. Hence the
direct source of the confiscation penalty must be sought
elsewhere. We have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> that one direct result of
the evolution of State-power was the conception of certain
‘crimes’ or ‘sins’ as an insult to the State and to its gods.
This insult had to be atoned for in a more substantial and
drastic manner than by the mere payment of an ‘honour-price.’
The State created new penalties, of which the most
important was civic degradation (ἄτιμία). In Greece, this
degradation in its graver forms was usually attended by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
perpetual exile and confiscation of property. It is impossible
to explain the conjunction of these two penalties, except on
the assumption of grades of criminality and of degrees of
severity in deterrence and in punishment. We cannot suppose
that wilful murder was the gravest crime or sin which the
State had to punish. Treason was much graver. The penalty
for treason, at least in fifth-century Athens, was death and
confiscation of property<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>: and this, we believe, was also the
penalty for parricide.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But the penalty for treason was
collective and hereditary. No descendant of a traitor could
be permitted to live, or to possess property, in the State
which condemned him. The penalty for parricide was, however,
individualistic, except in so far as confiscation implied
a certain injury to the offender’s family and his descendants.
If we may trust Andocides,<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the penalty for sacrilege was
death, without confiscation of property, in Athens in 399 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> thinks that after 403 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> confiscation did not accompany
death for any crime, even for treason. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
discussed a passage in the Third Philippic speech of Demosthenes,
which implies that there was a relaxation in the
punishment of treason which the orator attributes to lack of
patriotism. Demosthenes frequently compares the penalties
for manslaughter with the penalties for murder, and says that
they were rightly less severe.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> But if death <i>and</i> confiscation
were the penalties for murder, it would, we think, be rather
ironical to describe these penalties as ‘more’ or ‘less’ severe!
We shall see presently<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> that exile without confiscation was
the penalty for wounding with intent to kill. The phrase
which Demosthenes uses, in speaking of murder-penalties,
is unfortunately rather ambiguous. He says<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>: θανάτῳ καὶ
ἀειφυγίᾳ καὶ δημεύσει τῶν ὑπαρχόντων: here, we must
suppose that the first καί means ‘or,’ and we may suppose
that the second means ‘and’: and we translate ‘by death <i>or</i>
by exile and confiscation of property.’ This juxtaposition
of words suggests, on the whole, that death absolved the
murderer from confiscation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>We may support this conclusion from Pollux and from
Aristotle. The latter, speaking of the sale-commissioners
(πωληταί) at Athens, says<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> that, amongst other things, they
‘sell the estates of exiles from the court of Areopagus and the
property of State debtors.’ Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> says of these same
officers that they ‘sell the property of those who have fled
from the Areopagus after the first speech.’ If death was
accompanied by confiscation for wilful murder, why do not
Pollux and Aristotle say so? The reference of Pollux to
exiles who fled ‘after the first speech’ must apply to murder-exiles,
and to them alone. This whole subject has been ably
discussed by Glotz,<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and we are glad to be in agreement with
his main conclusion, that death absolved from confiscation in
cases of wilful murder. We agree with Glotz that the phrase
in Lysias,<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> ἐγὼ γὰρ νῦν καὶ περὶ τοῦ σώματος καὶ περὶ τῶν
χρημάτων καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων κινδυνεύω, does <i>not</i>
prove, as Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> maintains that it proves, the combination
of death and confiscation in such cases. The word σῶμα here,
as Meier<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> point out, means civic status, like
the Latin word <i>caput</i>, and need not refer to ‘life.’ In general,
we may say of the ancient authorities what Glotz says<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> in
reference to one of Antiphon’s <i>Tetralogies</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> that if the dual
punishment was legal it could not fail to have been mentioned.
If we add to this fact of omission the force of our general
reasoning as to the origin and <i>raison d’être</i> of the penalty of
confiscation, and the plain and obvious inferences from the
Attic murder laws, we cannot come to any other conclusion
than that which we have reached. Philippi must stand alone
as the sole exponent of the opposite opinion.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Private Settlement for Wilful Murder</span></h4>

<p>It is, however, rather inconsistent for Glotz to maintain
that confiscation (though prevented by death) was an invariable
concomitant of exile and at the same time to suppose that
‘private settlement’ for wilful murder was legal.<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> On purely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
material grounds, and apart from any religious considerations,<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
it seems obvious that no State would have legalised a bribe
which, by paralysing the action of the leading prosecutor,
removed from the murderer all civic degradation and deprived
the public treasury of that property which it regarded as a
partial retribution for the insult which its religion had received.
It is not necessary for Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> to propose, as a novel hypothesis,
that the phrase μηδ’ ἀποινᾶν, which forbade the amercement
of a murderer <i>en rupture de ban</i>, was a Solonian innovation.
Why should Solon have troubled to forbid such amercement
if ‘private settlement’ was legal? Glotz would answer that
the phrase μηδ’ ἀποινᾶν refers to the abolition of wergeld:
that wergeld was one of the pillars of clan-power: that Solon,
being opposed to clan-power, therefore abolished wergeld:
but that ‘private settlement’ was not wergeld and stood
therefore on a different plane: that Solon could not have
abolished ‘private settlement’ as long as the relatives had the
initiative in prosecution! This position we have already<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
discussed at length. It seems clear, <i>prima facie</i>, that ‘an
amercement <i>en rupture de ban</i>’ was not wergeld but was
very much akin to, if not actually identical with, ‘private
settlement.’ The splendid hypothesis of Glotz must therefore
be turned against himself. We may go a step farther. As
there is no reason for supposing that Solon rather than Dracon
should have prohibited ‘private settlement’ for wilful murder,
the phrase μηδ’ ἀποινᾶν, which does not refer to wergeld but
does forbid a kind of ‘private settlement’ or ‘amercement,’
is therefore quite properly Draconian. As for wergeld, we
have shown that it was abolished, or at least that it lost all
but the shadow of its substance, in the religious revolution
which declared murder a ‘pollution.’ Any possibility of its
resuscitation was removed when in the atmosphere of theocratic
religion the State gods claimed, as a retribution, the
property of the slayer. For cases of wilful murder at least,
which was now placed on an execrable pedestal beside treason
and sacrilege, the days of retribution to the relatives of the
slain were no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Refusal of Burial to Executed Murderers</span></h4>

<p>From Plato<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> we infer that there could be no burial for
murderers who did not go into exile and who were executed by
State officials.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> We need not again<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> call attention to the
importance of burial in ancient Greece. It alone gave repose
to the dead, and enabled the entombed spirit to be periodically
revivified, and even recalled from Hades, by the offerings made
at the grave. The refusal of burial to murderers, especially
kin-slayers, to traitors, and sacrilegious persons, was a particularly
revolting form of supplementary punishment. Their
bodies, stripped naked and cast beyond the boundaries, were
devoured by dogs and birds. No wonder that a pleader, in a
Demosthenic speech,<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> says that to them death was not easy,
as it was to ordinary men. No wonder that the slayer would
flee and lose his property rather than preserve it for his
children at the cost of such a fate.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Plotting and Contriving Murder</span></h4>

<p>Included in the category of wilful murderers, from the
legal standpoint, were the plotters or contrivers or instigators
of murder, at least when the plan materialised.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Andocides,
in his speech <i>On the Mysteries</i>, says: ‘This law existed in
former times and now also exists, namely, that the “plotter”
shall be liable to the same penalty as he that has wrought with
his hand.’<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> From the law<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> of Dracon which declares that
‘if anyone shall kill a murderer or be the cause of his death
(αἴτιος φόνου) while he abstains from the markets on the
civic boundary ... he shall be liable to the same penalties
as if he had killed an Athenian,’ we can infer that the equation
of plotting to kill with unjustifiable homicide, which is here
mentioned, applied also to ordinary wilful murder. Plato<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
confirms this conclusion, but suggests that in regard to burial
the slayer was more severely punished than the ‘plotter.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
‘If a person,’ he says, ‘shall not with his own hand (perpetrate)
but shall suggest to another a deed of murder and
by deliberate plotting (βουλήσει καὶ ἐπιβουλεύσει) be the
cause of slaying, let there be for him similarly ... a trial
and verdict.... If convicted let it be lawful for him to have
the family burial place.’ Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> puts the matter
beyond the pale of doubt when he says: ‘Remember, the
father of the priestess at Brauron, who was admitted not to
have touched the deceased, was sentenced to exile by the
Areopagus because he instigated the actual striker to strike.’
This sentence of banishment for plotting murder probably
carried with it the confiscation of the plotter’s property.
Aristotle tells us that one of the terms of the Peace made
between the rival factions in Athens in 403 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was as follows<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>:
‘Trials for homicide in accordance with the ancient
laws shall only be held in the case of persons who have killed
with their own hand.’ We can understand the political
significance of such a condition: but it was merely a temporary
amnesty for criminal political intrigue. The guilt of the
plotter or contriver of homicide is frequently referred to in
Attic tragedy. It was, we must suppose, a strong feature in
traditional legend. Euripides, as we shall see, refers to this
blood-guiltiness in several plays, for instance in the <i>Orestes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
the <i>Electra</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> the <i>Medea</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the <i>Andromache</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and the
<i>Heracleidae</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>But there is another kind of homicide guilt which may
easily be confused with this, namely ‘attempted murder.’
The Greek words βούλευσις and ὁ βουλεύσας are unfortunately
ambiguous, as we have already explained.<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Subjectively,
the guilt of the ‘plotter’ and of the ‘attempter’ is
the same, but objectively there is a difference. In one case
a human life is violently taken: in the other it is not. Lipsius
seems to have confused these issues.<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In Aristotle’s account
of the Attic murder courts, he finds a reference to βούλευσις
being tried at the <i>Palladium</i>. Knowing, from the speech of
Demosthenes <i>against Conon</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> that ‘plotters’ were tried at the
Areopagus, he supposes that a change of jurisdiction had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
taken place shortly before 330 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Before this, he implies
that there was a division of labour by which βουλεύσεις φόνου
ἀκουσίου were held at the Palladium, and βουλεύσεις
φόνου ἑκουσίου at the Areopagus. We confess we cannot
find any meaning in ‘plots of manslaughter’; it is a contradiction
in terms! Now Poste, in his translation of this
Aristotelian passage, does not use the word ‘plotters’ in
connexion with the Palladium. He translates thus:
‘Homicide with malice aforethought is tried in the Areopagus,
including homicide by wounding, by administering poison,
or by fire ... involuntary homicide, attempts to commit
homicide ... are tried in the Palladium.’ Thus, we see the
difficulties which arise from ambiguities of language. We
have quoted Andocides for the principle that plotting murder
was regarded as equivalent to wilful murder. A Draconian
law mentions both kinds as equally punished in cases of unjustifiable
homicide. Therefore plots to kill would normally
always have been tried by the Areopagus. Poste’s translation
of Aristotle, which is superior to Lipsius in this respect,
nevertheless suggests perhaps that ‘malicious wounding’
without fatal results was not tried by the Areopagus. The
law which Aristotle gives is that of Dracon, and it means that
the Areopagus tried wilful murderers, plotters of murder,
wounding with intent to kill, poisoning with intent to kill,
and arson—whether with intent to kill or not, we cannot say.
Attempted murder must be defined, we think, owing to some
discrimination in Attic legal procedure, as an attempt to kill
which did not cause any actual bodily harm.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Such attempts
may have been always tried at the Palladium, but what the
penalty was we cannot say—it was probably banishment for
a period of years.</p>

<p>For wounding with intent to kill, the penalty was perpetual
exile,<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> which was not accompanied, we think,<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> by
confiscation of property. The penalty for ‘plotting’ murder
(which was successful) was death or banishment, accompanied
by confiscation. Wounding without intent to kill was a case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
for civil damages, before the Heliastic courts—it was perhaps
a δίκη αἰκίας.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">State Execution of Death Penalty</span></h4>

<p>Before discussing the legal aspect of parricide and of kin-slaying
we must examine the question of the origin and
evolution of official State execution in the capital punishment
of homicide. The establishment of this method of execution
had, we believe, an important influence on the penalty for
parricide and, probably, for all general cases of wilful kin-slaying.
The prevailing opinion on this subject tends to
suppose that the method of private execution which is found
in the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> was the normal method of execution
in historical Greece and even in Athens until the time
of the orators, that is to say, the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The
only difference which can be found, according to this view,
between the Homeric and the historical modes of execution
is that in the former case the execution was unauthorised by
any written law or by any public trial, while in the latter case
it was legally authorised and permitted. Thus Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
holds that the relatives of the slain personally executed the
slayer in Athens in the fifth century, and that the exceptional
instances of State execution must be attributed to the sacred
‘right of sanctuary,’ and especially to the Athenian sanctuary
of the Semnai Theai. Glotz minimises as far as possible the
change which, he is compelled to admit, had taken place in
historical Greece. It was, he thinks,<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> from philanthropic
motives that the State consented to execute the murderer
if it was requested to do so by the relatives of the slain.
The old principle of primitive society: ‘de voluntario convictus
parentibus vel cognatis occisi tradatur occidendus’
gives place to an alternative principle that ‘murderers are
put to death sometimes by the judges, sometimes by the
relatives.’<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> At Athens, the ideals of philanthropy went one
step further. ‘L’exécution étant faite au nom du peuple
par le δήμιος (<i>public executioner</i>) le parent qui avait engagé<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
la poursuite contre le meurtrier assistait à son supplice.’<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
It is clear that Glotz regards this public execution as strangely
exceptional. He cannot, however, ignore the evidence of the
orators. But he seems quite certain that this custom did not
apply in the time of Dracon. ‘C’est dans l’Iliade et l’Odyssée
qu’on surprend les origines des φονικοὶ νόμοι. Ce que la
famille lésée demandait à l’état, d’après la loi de Dracon, c’était
la permission de se venger. Il fallait donc que son droit fût
reconnu, non seulement au moment des poursuites mais si
elle l’emportait, au moment du supplice ou de l’expulsion.
A l’origine de la juridiction sociale, comme dans la période
antérieure de l’arbitrage, le tribunal, pour faire exécuter ses
arrêts, n’avait que les armes de celui qu’il déclarait vainqueur.
C’était le principe universel en droit grec, que l’exécution du
jugement fût abandonnée à la partie gagnante.’<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> ... ‘Reconnaître
le privilège de la famille en matière de poursuite et
d’exécution, c’était pour Dracon admettre le principe de la
vengeance privée, sauf opposition de l’état.’<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But philanthropy
will not explain the evolution of State execution,
any more than the right of sanctuary will explain it. Public
execution may be of a much more revolting character than
the private infliction of death by an avenging relative in some
secret place or at the tomb of the victim. Moreover, Glotz
cannot suggest any definite date for the change of custom.
He would probably have attributed it to Solon, only that he
cannot assume a tremendous growth of philanthropy in that
space of twenty years which separated him from Dracon;
and he could not attribute an act of philanthropy to a legislator
whose main object was the exaltation of State power!
We admit that there is a certain suggestion of private execution
in the infliction of death which was not only permitted but
commanded when a murder-outlaw returned to forbidden
territory. But in this case slaying was not the exclusive
privilege of the relatives of the slain, but it was the duty of
‘the first citizen who met him’ to act as the avenger of the
law. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> described such an ‘execution’
as a case of justifiable homicide. It is not in the least indicative
of a <i>system</i> of private execution. The slayer acts as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
State executioner. Neither can we argue, as Glotz does,<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
from the right of an injured husband to slay an adulterer <i>in
flagrante delicto</i>, to the prevalence of private execution. Such
an act is definitely declared by law to be justifiable homicide.</p>

<p>Our opinion on this subject may be thus summarised:
(1) It is misleading to assume that the Achaean system of
vengeance which is found in the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> is the
norm or standard of blood-vengeance either of tribal village
communities or of synoekised States possessing a strong centralised
government. Even amongst the Achaeans, we have
shown,<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> there was a certain submission to military discipline,
to a public opinion which discriminated between murder and
vengeance, and therefore the avenger’s act was not entirely
‘private.’</p>

<p>(2) On the analogy of Indian tribal life, which Maine<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
has investigated, we may suppose that amongst Pelasgian
village communities or tribal cities there existed a body of
official police who acted as the supporters and preservers of
tribal law. If, in such societies, homicide was not officially
avenged, this was only because homicide was what we should
now call a ‘civil offence,’ a matter for retribution between
the families concerned.</p>

<p>(3) It was in post-Achaean times, and especially in the
Hesiodic period and in the Dark Ages of Greek history, that
murder and vengeance passed outside the control of law or
discipline. In such conditions it was more than probable
that murder would be unjustly punished, but it was equally
probable that it would not be avenged at all. Into this abyss
of chaos came in the seventh century the Apolline religion of
‘pollution.’ The birth of great States, the dawn of synoekised
nationhood, was overshadowed by the wrath of gods
and ghosts, which reflected the vindictive hatred of human
vengeance. Amongst the first essential duties of the new-born
States was the prevention of murder and the regulation
of vengeance. In Attica, especially, where the blight of chaos
fell most lightly,<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> could the new religion be most promptly
honoured and obeyed.</p>

<p>(4) We will not maintain that the pollution-doctrine, alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and unaided, would have led to the official State execution
of the penalty of death. Amongst the Hebrews,<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> one may
point out, the ‘pollution’ of the murderer coexisted with the
avenger of blood. The obligation of the State, one may
hold, was satisfied by the trial and the condemnation of the
murderer, and by the sentence of outlawry which was pronounced
against him. But we would suggest, on the other
hand, that Greek States did not confine themselves to a
sentence of outlawry. The murderer, in Greek law, at the
moment of his condemnation, nay at the moment that he
challenged a verdict and uttered his second speech at the
trial, no longer ranked as an outlaw; he was a State criminal
whose insult to the State and its gods must be atoned by
public execution. Like the sacrilegious criminal, he must be
executed solemnly and with public execration. His body
cannot be buried in the tomb of his fathers. Naked, it is
cast beyond the civic boundaries, amidst the curses and the
groans of the mob, to be eaten by dogs and wild birds when
it has been bruised and mutilated by the stones and missiles
which are hurled not by the relatives only, but by an angered
populace.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot suppose that the pollution-doctrine of itself
degraded murderers to the same level with sacrilegious
criminals, at least in the judgment of Apolline theocratic
nobles, the pre-historical Greek sacerdotal aristocracy. From
the <i>Ion</i> of Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> we infer that sacrilege was the main
element which the Delphian nobles and magistrates condemned
in the attempted murder of Ion, the priest of Apollo,
by Creusa. We cannot infer that ordinary homicide would
have called for such public action unless we assume that the
Delphians, in addition to being priests, were also the leaders
of a civic government. Their action in the <i>Andromache</i><a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> in
slaying, in conjunction with Orestes, Neoptolemus, who was
consecrated by his presence in the sanctuary, cannot be
reconciled with their procedure in the <i>Ion</i> unless we assume
that the death of Neoptolemus was an act of vengeance.
Such indeed it was, but, as Euripides presents it,<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> it was
entirely out of proportion to the offence. The attitude of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
Delphians in the <i>Ion</i>, and also the survival of the avenger of
blood in Hebrew society under the operation of ‘pollution’
doctrines, prevents us from asserting that private execution
was abolished by ‘pollution.’</p>

<p>(5) But we have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> that the murder code of
historical Greece was a compromise between three forces:
(<i>a</i>) the tribal traditions of material retribution to the relatives
of the slain; (<i>b</i>) the Apolline doctrine of homicide as an offence
against the gods; and (<i>c</i>) the conception of murder as an
insult to the majesty of the State and to its gods, which arose
after the synoekism of local peoples and the establishment
of strong civic governments. As we believe that the pollution-doctrine
abolished wergeld, so we believe that the concurrence
of the pollution-doctrine with State power led to the abolition
of private execution for homicide in the rare cases in which
the murderer refused to flee and was put to death, because
he had the audacity to perjure himself in the attempt
to prove his innocence. It follows that official execution
was in existence in Dracon’s time. There is no more
reason for delaying its arrival twenty years in order to
link its advent with the name of Solon than there is for
supposing that wergeld was not abolished before the time of
Solon. Between 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and the time of Demosthenes we
know of no civic or legal innovation to which such a change
could be attributed. The ‘Eleven’ who obeyed the verdicts
of the Heliasts also obeyed the decision of the Areopagus
and of the pre-Solonian Ephetae courts.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Such evidence for State execution as we possess in Plato
and the Attic orators, far from suggesting that it was a recent
innovation, implies on the contrary that in their time it was
a well-established practice.</p>

<p>Lysias,<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> speaking of a certain Menestratus who was
a prominent informer and an accuser of citizens under the
Thirty Tyrants, says that the citizens of the restored democracy
‘having arrested Menestratus in court on the ground that
he was a murderer,<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> condemned him justly to death and
handed him over to the public executioner, and he was cudgelled
till he was dead’ (ἀπετυμπανίσθη). There is, of course, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
political complication in this case. The guilt of treason was
added to that of murder. Yet the procedure is similar to
that which would have taken place if an ordinary murderer
challenged the verdict of the Court.</p>

<p>Plato,<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> speaking of the punishment which was decreed
for a slave who had wilfully murdered a freeman, and who
was condemned to death, says: ‘Let the public executioner
lead him to the tomb of the deceased or to a place from which
he may see the tomb, and having scourged him with as many
stripes as the plaintiff (a relative of deceased) shall order,
slay him if he survives the scourging.’ Even on a slave,
then, who had murdered a man, the relatives could not
personally execute the death sentence. Again, speaking of
wilful kin-slaying, for which, in his code of laws, there is no
option but death, he says<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>: ‘Let the servants (ὑπηρέται)
of the judges and the rulers (ἄρχοντες) put him to death
and cast him out naked to an appointed place where three
roads meet, and let all the public officials (or magistrates) on
behalf of the whole State carry each a stone and hurl it at the
head of the corpse, and free the whole city from pollution,
and, after this, carry the corpse to the civic boundaries and
cast it out unburied according to law’ (τῷ νόμῳ). There
is here no mention of the relatives of the slain. We must
suppose that if these relatives had been the normal
executioners, the kin-slayer would not ordinarily have been
slain at all. Human nature, as well as the actual evidence,
compels us to believe that the relatives of a kin-slayer would
have revolted at the infliction of death, whether in Pelasgian
or in historical times.</p>

<p>Again, Aeschines suggests that the enemies of a man condemned
to death were impotent to do more than attend as
spectators at his execution when he says<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>: ‘It is not death
that is so terrible: the really horrible thing is the insult
suffered at the last moment of life. How pitiable a fate, to
see an enemy’s face relaxing into a broad grin, and to hear
with one’s ears the insults of enmity.’ This quotation has
been taken by Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> to imply that the memory of private
execution was still vivid in Athens in the time of Aeschines;
but in our opinion it merely shows that public execution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
was a regular and established custom. A private enemy
could have laughed as a freeman died: he could have counted
the stripes and commanded their continuance, as a slave
murderer was scourged to death. But his hand was bound:
he could not strike the blow of vengeance.</p>

<p>Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> attributes to a certain Diodorus, whose
uncle was indicted for impiety by Androtion, because he had
not prosecuted his nephew on a charge of parricide, the following
statement: ‘If Androtion had succeeded in his prosecution
of my uncle I as a convicted parricide should have been
deprived not only of my property but of my life: nay, even
to die, which is the common lot of all, would not for me have
been easy.’ This passage implies that Diodorus, if convicted,
in this indirect manner,<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> of parricide, would have suffered
a cruel death. The conjunction of the death penalty with
confiscation in this instance points very forcibly to State
execution. Hence we believe that the cruel death to which
Diodorus refers was the public execution which Plato describes
when he speaks of stones being hurled at the corpse, and of
its abandonment to the dogs and the birds. Glotz has, we
think, completely misinterpreted this passage. He thinks<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
that the penalty indicated is perpetual exile and thus renders
the concluding words of Diodorus: ‘Je ne serais pas seulement
dépouillé de ma fortune, je ne pourrais plus vivre, et le réfuge
commun de tous les hommes, la mort libératrice, ne serait
pas un asile pour moi.’</p>

<p>Demosthenes confirms our hypothesis of the evolution of
State execution in another passage which concerns wilful
murder. Speaking of the accuser, he says<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>: ‘If his accusation
is considered just and he obtains a conviction for murder,
even then he gets no power over the condemned man, who is
given over for punishment to the laws and to the persons
charged with that official duty: the accuser may be a spectator
while the condemned suffers the penalty which the law imposes,
but he can do no more.’ This quotation speaks for
itself. Its value as a link in our chain of reasoning it would
be impossible to overestimate. The conclusion which it
points is indisputable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>The explanation which Demosthenes gives of this law is
not, indeed, very profound. ‘How comes this to be the case,’
he says,<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> ‘men of Athens? Because they that made the laws
originally, whoever they were, Heroes or Gods, did not (seek
to) oppress the unfortunate, but in a humane way as far as
they could with justice, they alleviated their misery.’ But
Demosthenes shows a certain clarity of vision in another
place in which he examines the question why the laws were
so careful to preserve the lives of murderers abroad. One of
the reasons was, he says,<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> ‘to prevent an infinite series in the
avenging of injuries.’ We have already quoted Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
for a similar sentiment: ‘Right well,’ he says, ‘did our ancestors
in olden times enact these laws ... they punished the
murderer with exile, but they suffered no one to slay him in
return, for (in that event) each successive avenger would be
liable for bloodshed.’ This sentiment may have been inspired
by the atmosphere in which Euripides himself lived, and taken
in conjunction with that which we have just cited from
Demosthenes, suggests that the Greeks did not practise the
‘private execution’ of death penalties within the living
memory of those authors. In the light of our conclusion
we shall proceed to examine the position of parricide and of
kin-slaying in historical Attic law.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Parricide and Kin-slaying</span></h4>

<p>Two problems present themselves for solution: (<i>a</i>) First
of all we must inquire whether parricide and kin-slaying were
civic offences which were punishable by State law or whether
the avenging of these deeds of blood was entirely at the
discretion of the relatives and the clansmen; (<i>b</i>) secondly, we
must decide what the nature of the legal penalty was (if the
penalty was legal) in the historical era. The opinion of Glotz
on this subject has already been given in outline.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> He
suggests that the pollution-doctrine affected the penalty for
parricide, but he maintains that it was merely a public opinion
which reinforced this doctrine and that the historical penalty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
was perpetual exile. The Draconian law, he holds,<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> did
not interfere in the jurisdiction of the family. ‘En réalité
Dracon n’édictait aucune sanction contre le parricide parce
que l’Etat n’avait pas à s’occuper avec cela. La juridiction
de la famille subsistait sur tous les points où elle n’était pas
abolie par une disposition expresse. La loi ne parlait donc
du parricide ... toutes ces questions échappaient à sa
compétence.’<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> ‘Quand la conscience sociale se mit à
intervenir contre les criminels, elle se proposait seulement
de faire respecter les vieux usages. Elle obligea tous les
meurtriers à quitter le pays au moins pour un certain temps:
le meurtrier d’un proche, elle l’obligea ... à sortir de sa
famille pour toujours.’<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In passing, we may note how inconsistent is this statement
regarding the exile penalty for homicide with Glotz’s
favourite hypothesis of the legality of ‘private settlement.’<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>It is not true that the pollution-doctrine confirmed and
preserved old customs. It was in many respects opposed to
them. It tolerated them only by way of compromise. The
last clause of the quotation which declares that the penalty
for kin-slaying was perpetual exile is based upon a misinterpretation
of a passage in the <i>Laws</i> of Plato. Plato
clearly states that death was the invariable penalty for kin-slaying.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
The exile penalty to which Glotz refers is applied
by Plato only to extenuated or involuntary kin-slaying, and
in this connexion there is no question of perpetual exile in the
ordinary sense, but merely of banishment from the domestic
hearth, not from the State or the country of the slayer.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Glotz quotes various analogies, such as<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> the Irish clan-law,
which is revealed in the <i>Senchus Mor</i>, in support of his theory.
But in historical Attic law we have left behind us the clan-laws
of tribal society. We are in the presence of civic legislation
and of international religious authorisation.</p>

<p>Caillemer,<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> who is admittedly influenced by Glotz, holds
a very similar view. He says: ‘Il est très vraisemblable que
la juridiction de la famille ne fut pas notablement modifiée
par Dracon, et que le chef de famille garda le droit de juger et<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
de punir sa femme, ses enfants, ses esclaves.... Avant Solon,
le chef de famille, en vertu de sa magistrature domestique,
pouvait ou bien mettre à mort la coupable, ou bien la chasser
de sa maison.... Solon n’ignorait pas qu’il y avait à Athènes
des parricides: mais il laissait à la famille le soin de les punir....
La société n’a pas à intervenir directement. Si cependant
les parents manquent à leur devoir, une action publique va être
donnée contre eux et elle pèsera de tout son poids sur l’homicide.’
The ‘public action’ which is here referred to is clearly the
indictment for impiety, such as was brought by Androtion
against the uncle of Diodorus.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> But this indirect State
interference which Caillemer is compelled by a passage in
Demosthenes to regard as admissible in cases of parricide was
the only kind of State interference which was permissible in
cases of ordinary homicide in historical Athens. If then
parricide and homicide stand on the same plane, so far as
‘social justice’ is concerned, why should we assume a distinction
between them in regard to State jurisdiction and
State execution? Caillemer attributes undue importance to
an anecdote which is related by Cicero concerning Solon.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
‘On demandait,’ he says, ’un jour à Solon pourquoi il n’avait
pas établi de peine contre le parricide. “J’ai pensé,” répondit-il,
“que personne ne s’en rendrait coupable. Pourquoi
statuer contre un attentat jusqu’alors sans exemple? Le
défendre pourrait en inspirer l’idée.” In view of the fact
that Solon did not change the murder-laws of Dracon, that
the wording of those laws was sufficiently general to include
kin-slayers, and that Roman ideas of jurisdiction and execution
were different from those of Greece, we should be slow to base
any theory upon such an anecdote. We read in Livy<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
that a certain P. Horatius, the father of a famous warrior
who in a moment of passionate triumph slew his sister, and
who was in consequence arraigned before the King and the
Duumviri, said to the judges that he considered his daughter
was justly slain, and that otherwise he would have punished
his son by right of his parental authority.</p>

<p>Again, Livy tells us<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> how a certain Cassius, a consul, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
soon as he went out of office, was sentenced to death and
executed. ‘There are some who say that his father inflicted
the punishment, that after putting him on trial in private
he scourged him and put him to death.’ Such passages
illustrate the well-known <i>patria potestas</i> of a Roman father.
Yet even in Rome the State could interfere in such matters,
since we find that a Decemvir ordered the arrest and the imprisonment
of a certain Virginius who had slain his daughter.<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Rome, however, can give us no really valid evidence for Greek
law. The power of a father to sell his daughter as a slave,
which Solon abolished, was a remnant of <i>patria potestas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
But Solon’s interference in such matters proves that the
sacred jurisdiction and power of the family had been already
in his time invaded by the State. All matters which concerned
public morality and utility, all matters which were affected
by national or international religion, had naturally passed out
of the exclusive control of the kindred. We have already
indicated<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> the survival in historical Greece of clan-courts
and of local religious corporations. We have also quoted
Plato<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> for the operation of local jurisdictions in cases
of ‘wounding in a passion,’ between members of the same
kindred.</p>

<p>But the religious doctrine of pollution placed the actual
slaying of kinsmen on an altogether different plane. Moreover,
we believe that the evolution of State execution affected
the question of the penalty for kin-slaying. Demosthenes,
in two passages<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> recently cited, makes his client Diodorus
say that if Androtion had succeeded in the indictment for
impiety which he had brought against the uncle of Diodorus,
he himself, as a result of the indictment, would not only have
lost his property but would also have lost his life. Now such
a confiscation of property must have been a State confiscation:
and the only authority which could decree or execute such a
confiscation was a State court and State officials. It is therefore
natural to assume that the death penalty would also
have been carried out by the State.</p>

<p>Plato describes, in hideous detail, the execution by public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
magistrates of the slayer of a kinsman.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Even for malicious
wounding within the family, the penalty of death is decreed.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
For wounding in a passion, a fine could be imposed by the
parent or the male kindred of the offender: but if a parent
was wounded by his child, death could be inflicted, even by
a tribal court, in which none of the relatives of the child could
act as judges.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Lysias<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> makes one of his pleaders repudiate, most emphatically,
the suggestion that parricide was not criminal and
illegal. The word ἀνδροφόνος, or homicide, includes, he says,
implicitly if not explicitly, the slayer of a parent. Pollux,<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
however he be interpreted, must be regarded as implying that
parricide was a crime, which was probably punished by the
Areopagus. We have quoted the relevant passage already.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Pollux is describing the Areopagus, which was the admittedly
regular court for wilful murder. He refers to the preliminary
affidavits, and, speaking of the final trial, is represented by
the text of Dindorf as saying ‘After the first speech it is
lawful to go into exile—if one has slain one’s parents’! Now,
if we suppose that this text is correct, it would follow that
parricide was a State offence which was judged by the Areopagus
State court. But the same conclusion can be maintained
even if, as we believe, the text is incorrect. We believe that
Pollux wrote not εἰ but εἰ μὴ, and that he means ‘unless
one slays one’s parents.’ He clearly implies that parricide
also came before the Areopagus.</p>

<p>Finally, the <i>Euthyphro</i> of Plato, which represents a man
actually bringing an indictment or a charge of murder against
his father, cannot be explained on the assumptions of Glotz
and Caillemer. The weakness of Euthyphro’s legal position
is pointed out by Socrates,<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> namely that Euthyphro was
not a kinsman of the slain. The threatened indictment was
a δίκη, not a γραφὴ. It was a regular charge of homicide
which was lodged with the Archon Basileus.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Now Socrates’
objection would not apply if the slain man had been a kinsman
of the accuser: and this would necessarily have been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
case if the father of Euthyphro had slain a member of his own
family or kindred.</p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> that in the days of private vengeance
and of tribal society, kin-slaying was normally punished by
exile, as wergeld was impossible, and kinsmen revolted
against the infliction of death. In those days, kin-slaying
was normally a matter for the jurisdiction of the clan. In
historical times, kin-slaying was punished by death and the
confiscation of property—and these penalties can no longer
be regarded as in conflict with clan-psychology, since the
slayer was prosecuted in a State Court and was executed by
State officials. All these facts are therefore quite consistent
and they are mutually explanatory. It was the doctrine of
pollution and the evolution of civic government which produced
so drastic a revolution in the punishment of kin-murder.</p>

<p>We can now understand quite clearly the meaning of
Plato’s reference to the penalty of kin-slaying: ‘Of a kindred
blood defiled,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> ‘there is no other cleansing, and
the pollution cannot be washed away until the life of the
slayer shall atone for kin-blood by kin-blood and appease
and set to rest the anger of all the kindred. It is proper that
a person be restrained from such deeds by the fear of such
punishments from the gods.’ Euripides also expresses the
same sentiment in the <i>Medea</i>. The Chorus say<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Stern upon mortals the vengeance falleth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For kin’s blood spilt: from the earth it calleth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A voice from the gods, and the slayers appalleth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">On whose homes it shall light.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How then do we suppose that the murder of a husband
by his wife, or of a wife by her husband, was punished in Attic
law? Such parties were usually not akin by blood. Yet
they lived in the same house and they ate at the same table.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
The penalty in this case was, we think, precisely the same
as the penalty for ordinary wilful homicide. The slayer had
the option of going into exile for ever if he fled before conviction,
or of suffering death at the hands of the public
executioner if he did not flee. Hence, perhaps, Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[224]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
is thinking of the historical Attic law when, in the <i>Orestes</i>,
he makes Tyndareus assert that Orestes should not have slain
his mother, but should have put her on trial and have banished
her as an exile for ever. We must assume that in the event
of exile the property of such slayers was confiscated, though
it seems very cruel that children whom murder and vengeance
had deprived of both their parents were compelled in addition
to forfeit their patrimony.</p>

<p>The malicious wounding of a husband by his wife or of a
wife by her husband did not, apparently, involve such a
confiscation but did involve perpetual exile. This identical
penalty is applied by Lysias to ordinary cases of malicious
wounding.<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Hence Plato is quite authentic when he says<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
‘If a woman wounds her husband with intent to kill, or a
husband his wife, let (the offender) undergo a perpetual exile
... let guardians manage the property and take care of the
children as if they were orphans.... In case there are no
children let the kindred, as far as cousins, on the male and
female side, come together and appoint an heir.’</p>

<p>It is in cases of involuntary homicide or of homicide in
a passion, between man and wife, that the influence of the
pollution doctrine is especially apparent. The penalty for such
deeds, as Plato assures us, was perpetual exile from the family
and temporary exile from the State. Now, temporary exile,
in ordinary cases of involuntary homicide, was terminated by
the ‘appeasement’ of the relatives of the slain. The primeval
tribal law in which ‘appeasement’ ultimately originated
recognised the payment of material retribution in cases of
husband-wife slaying. But the ‘pollution’ doctrine prevented
the survival, in historical times, of ‘appeasement’ in cases
of this kind. Plato<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> assures us that such offenders could
never, in any circumstances, return to dwell in their old homes
with their children.</p>

<p>We have now completed our review of the murder-laws of
Dracon. We have not referred in this connexion to the law
which related to the seizure of hostages in default of extradition
(ἀνδροληψία) because this law has already<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
discussed and explained. We have also omitted many legal
details, of which some will find a place in our next chapter,
which deals with Attic murder-courts, and others have not
been considered sufficiently important or sufficiently relevant
to our main purpose—which is, in effect, the philosophical
explanation of the origin and evolution of Greek homicide
law.</p>

<p>There is one point which, in conclusion, we wish to
emphasise, namely the value and the importance of the
Platonic code when considered as a supplement to the laws
of Dracon in cases where they do not directly reproduce
them. It is easy to assert that Plato is an idealist when his
ideas do not correspond with one’s pet hypotheses.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> But
what, we may ask, was the source of Platonic idealism, and
was this source of such a kind that it would have affected
the historicity of his homicide-laws? The idealism of Plato
was, we think, derived from the Orphic-Pythagoreans, and
also to some extent from the Eleatic philosophers. His
theory of ‘ideas’ originated, as Burnet has shown,<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> with
the Pythagoreans. So, Glotz rightly says<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>: ‘l’eschatologie
de Platon présente une grande cohésion. Elle vient de
l’orphisme.’ Was there, then, in Orphism any special doctrine
which could have affected Plato’s attitude to homicide?
Could such a doctrine have imported new ideas into Plato’s
legislation? It is true that murderers were excluded from
the famous Mysteries at Eleusis when those Mysteries
came under Orphic domination, from 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Murderers were punished by everlasting fire in the Orphic
Tartarus,<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and parricides and matricides were singled out
for the most severe punishment. Aristophanes has a line<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
which has been interpreted as referring<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> to human bloodshed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Ὀρφεὺς μὲν γὰρ τελετὰς θ’ ἡμῖν κατέδειξε φόνων τ’ ἀπέχεσθαι:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the φόνοι which are here mentioned denote the sacrificial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
slaying of animals, to which the Orphics objected. Horace<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
puts it more clearly when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">silvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Orphism, then, stands in the same relation to the Apolline
religion of pollution as Christianity does to Judaic religion.
It supplements the punishment which angry deities send upon
criminals here on earth by a further punishment hereafter.
But, considered as modifying factors in the evolution of social
law, the Judaic and the Apolline doctrine of pollution are
incomparably more important. We have seen that Christianity
accepted wergeld in Europe,<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> while Judaism
abolished it in Israel.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Orphism, as we conceive it, had no
effect upon the murder-laws of Greece. Plato was, naturally,
sympathetic towards the Orphic religion: still he does not
place much trust in merely posthumous punishment for so
great a crime as homicide: and hence in his penal code he
falls back on the historical Greek laws which were the offspring
of Apolline religion, because there was no other code available.
Thus he says<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>: ‘Let our prelude include a “myth” which
many of those who seriously take to heart such matters in
the mysteries have heard and believe firmly, namely, that
for such persons (<i>i.e.</i> murderers) there is a punishment in
Hades: or that it is necessary for them to come back hither
to suffer punishment according to nature (by a natural law),
to suffer from others what they had done themselves ... for
him who is persuaded ... and who terribly fears such punishment,
there is no necessity to frame a law, but for him who is
not persuaded let the following law be written thus.’ Here
Plato, as a prelude to his homicide legislation, definitely states
that these laws are intended for the general public and not
for Orphic votaries. So again<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> he says: ‘Death is not the
extreme punishment: the pains spoken of in regard to such
persons (<i>i.e.</i> murderers) in Hades are still more extreme:
though they who tell such truths accomplish nothing by way
of deterrence (ἀποτροπή) for people of such a character:
otherwise there would never have arisen matricides and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
impious attacks on parents. Hence the punishments here in
this life for such crimes should rival in efficacy those in Hades.’
Here we see that, despite the Orphic sympathies of Plato,
he has to adopt as his legal model the historical Greek murder
code which was mainly derived from the Apolline ‘pollution’
doctrine. He has to appeal to the religious sanctions of
Apollinism, just as in modern society Christian preachers
appeal to Judaic doctrines when a more ideal and higher
conception of religion fails to deter the shedder of blood.
The homicide code of Plato was therefore not affected by
Orphic ideas. It was based on the Attic code of Dracon, and
also on local traditions, or, as Glotz would describe it,<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
‘la vieille jurisprudence des exégètes.’</p>

<p>Attic legends concerning origin of courts for homicide: the accounts of Pollux,
of Aristotle, of Demosthenes: question of a γραφὴ φόνου: Plato’s
<i>Euthyphro</i>: author’s theory of the origin of Attic courts for homicide:
Dracon and the Ephetae: Solon and the Areopagus: the Exegetae.</p>

</div>

<p>In an earlier section<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of this work we have explained what we
consider to have been the origin and the evolution of judicial
investigation in matters of homicide. We have said<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that
‘the evolution of early Greek judicial authority is not a transition
from a crude arbitrary local jurisdiction to an efficient
central compulsory jurisdiction but rather a gradual extension
to wider areas, in accordance with increasing political synoekism,
of the judicial functions which had been previously discharged
with equal authority within smaller areas.’ The influence of
the ‘pollution’ doctrine in compelling the State to investigate
and to adjudicate concerning degrees of blood-guiltiness has also
been clearly shown.<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We shall now apply our conclusions to
the Attic homicide courts—the only Greek courts of which we
have any precise and authentic knowledge. The actual origin
of the Athenian courts is surrounded by mystery and obscurity.
Many of the legends which refer to their foundation are clearly
the fabrications of men who were born when these courts were
already old. Places which in later times came to be notoriously
associated with the courts which sat there to give judgment in
homicide cases, had previously, in many instances, been consecrated
by legends which had no connexion with homicide at
all. The ‘Areopagus,’ for example, that is, the Hill of Ares,
may have been at one time the scene of a battle in which
Theseus, an Ionian King of Attica, proved victorious. The
place would then naturally have come to be called ‘the Hill of
Ares.’ Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> says that the hill got its name from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
sacrifice which was offered to Ares by the Amazons whom
Theseus defeated. Glotz points out that there was no temple
of Ares on the Areopagus, and he holds that the connexion of
Ares with this hill was derived from a time when Ares signified
not only war but murder, as in the Homeric phrase, Ἄρεω
ἀλκτήρ (avenger of blood).<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This homicidal rôle of Ares,
and, moreover, the existence of an altar of Athene <i>Areia</i> at the
Areopagus, which is referred to by Pausanias, explains, he
thinks, the real origin of the place-name. But Pausanias was
not of this opinion. ‘Here also,’ he says, ‘is the Areopagus,
so called because Ares was first tried here.’<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This is really a
third hypothesis as to the meaning of the word. Aeschylus
gives also a fourth explanation. The place may be called, he
suggests,<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from the Erinnyes who here became ‘appeased’
under the form of Semnai Theai, but who were called <i>Arai</i> or
Curses beneath the earth. The main point of interest in this
confusion of opinions is that the hill called the Areopagus was
in historical times so closely associated with trials for homicide
that Ares had to be conceived as a murderer in order to retain
his connexion with the place. Orestes, whose sojourn at Athens,
as Homer relates it, had no connexion with homicide,<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was
associated, in legend, with the Areopagus to such an extent
that Ares was almost eclipsed and the Athenians found it
difficult to decide whose trial came first! Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
wisely refrains from deciding. ‘In ancient times,’ he says,
‘as we are informed by tradition, the gods on this tribunal
alone deigned to demand and render justice for murder....
Poseidon claimed justice against Ares because of the murder
of his son Halirrhothius, and the Twelve Gods sat in judgment
between the Erinnyes and Orestes. Such are its ancient
glories.’ Aeschylus is naturally led by dramatic considerations
to regard the trial of Orestes as the first<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Athenian murder-trial:
and therefore, out of courtesy to Ares, he is led to reject
the legend that Ares was a murderer, in favour of what we
believe to have been an older story, namely that Ares was a
war god to whom, on that hill, the Amazons sacrificed when
they were overthrown by Theseus.<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> accepts as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
fact the trial of Ares on the Areopagus, but he places it prior
to the trial of Orestes. It is quite impossible to base any
historical reasoning upon such legends. The mention of the
Areopagus in a law of Dracon—or rather, as we think, in a
Solonian modification of it—is the only genuine evidence for
the antiquity of the Court.</p>

<p>Similarly, in regard to the Delphinium, Pausanias implies
that it was believed to be as old as Theseus: but we have not
the least doubt that its exclusive association with pleas of
justifiable homicide was a product of the seventh and sixth
centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Pausanias says<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>: ‘The Delphinium is the
court for those who plead that they have committed justifiable
homicide, which was the plea of Theseus when he was acquitted
for killing Pallas and his sons ... and before the acquittal
of Theseus every manslayer had to flee for his life.’ Such
statements belong to the region of aetiological legend, but not
to that of historical fact. Theseus slew Pallas and his sons in
war<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; hence his act was not homicide in the ordinary sense.
We have seen that in Homer<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Pelasgian manslayers had not
to flee, for they could pay their share of the wergeld and
remain in the home of their fathers. It is strange that Orestes
was not more definitely connected with the Delphinium court,
for his plea in most legends was justifiable homicide. Demosthenes
suggests that Orestes’ acquittal by the Areopagus
was the cause of the establishment of the Delphinium.<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But
Orestes was bound to the Areopagus by ‘hooks of steel’ and
he could not be divorced from it! We have little doubt that
the Delphinium was a temple of Apollo at Athens long before
it became associated with homicide-trials. Legends which
explain it as the court of Apollo the Delphian justifier of Orestes,
or of Apollo the justifiable slayer of the Δελφίνη, or Python,<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
do not prove that the distinction between justifiable and
unjustifiable homicide originated in or had any essential
connexion with this temple.</p>

<p>Legend is equally powerless to explain the birth of the
Palladium court. Pollux is content to give a legend which
explains only the origin of the temple, and even this story is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
probably fictitious.<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> tells us a similar tale about
the Argives and the wooden image of Pallas, but in order to
account for the origin of the court as distinct from the temple,
he relates that Demophon, son of Theseus, was tried here for
having slain, in an attack upon the Argives, an Athenian citizen
whom in the confusion he had not recognised as such. But
we have seen<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that such slaying, in Attic law, was justifiably
accidental homicide, not manslaughter. Yet Pausanias fancies
that he is explaining the origin of a manslaughter court! No
wonder that he feels that ‘the reason why he was tried is a
matter of dispute.’<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In his account of the Prytaneum court which tried inanimate
objects or animals guilty of bloodshed and which also brought
in verdicts against unknown murderers, Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> refers to the
ceremony of slaying an ox at the Bouphonia. ‘They call one
of the priests,’ he says, ‘Ox-Killer, and he, after throwing the
axe, runs away, for that is the usage: and, as if they did not
know who had done the deed, they bring the axe into court as
defendant.’ The first instance of such a trial occurred, he
thinks,<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in the time of Erechtheus: ‘Then first did Ox-Killer
kill an ox, and left the axe and fled the country, and the axe
was forthwith acquitted after trial and is tried annually even
nowadays.’ Pausanias is probably correct in attributing to
the Prytaneum an ancient origin. But the Bouphonia belongs
to a different strand of development from that in which
originated the trial of inanimate objects. There is a stage in
the evolution of ancient religion in which the slaying of an
animal was a religious offence and needed expiation.<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This
stage is quite independent of that in which the shedding of
human blood became sinful. (We speak, of course, only of
ordinary homicide, for in the earliest days<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the slaying of a
kinsman was a sin against the family ghosts and the gods of the
hearth.) Now, the tabu against animal sacrifice had probably
disappeared, in Greece, long before the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
when the tabu against human bloodshed had set in. But
ritual is conservative, and the original rite of the Bouphonia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
continued to be carried out at a time when its meaning was lost
and its origin forgotten. A new meaning—but a wrong meaning—was
grafted upon this rite, a meaning which is derived
from the trial of guilty animals and inanimate objects in the
central Prytaneum court. Now this central trial was forced
upon the State by the doctrine of pollution in the seventh
century. The trial of animals at the Prytaneum cannot therefore
be explained by the Bouphonic rite. The account of
Pausanias is therefore misleading. We do not assert that the
trial of animals and of inanimate objects in local courts was not
as old as the Bouphonic rite. There is no time-limit to the
antiquity of a jurisdiction which was necessary for the assessment
of material damages, in such cases, in tribal society.
This jurisdiction was also, we believe, appealed to in pleas of
accidental homicide, as well as in cases where the slayer was
unknown. But there is a vast gulf between local and central
jurisdiction in such matters. Synoekism and ‘pollution’ were
the two factors which bridged that gulf, but that result cannot
have been earlier than the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Hence we
assert that the two events which are connected by Pausanias
belong to two different strands of development.</p>

<p>Finally, in regard to the homicide court at Phreatto, legend
is particularly at fault. Is this because the court was established
very late, or is it that the conception on which the court
was based could not easily have found analogies in the distant
past? The latter, we believe, is the more correct explanation.
The court at Phreatto was clearly and unmistakably derived
from the religion of ‘pollution.’ The defendant pleaded from
the deck of a ship and was not permitted to set foot on the
shore.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This court had jurisdiction in the event of a person,
who was already exiled for manslaughter, being afterwards,
before his exile terminated, indicted for murder.<a id="FNanchor_1174b" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> We may
refer both accusations to the same act or to different acts. We
may suppose, either that new evidence had been obtained which
destroyed the plea of manslaughter guilt which had once been
successfully advanced, or that an entirely new deed of blood
had been laid at the door of the exile. It would have been
clearly very difficult to find archaic facts so similar in general
outline to such events that they could have been perverted so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
as to form archaic precedents. Legend<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> revealed no better
precedent than the story of Teucer pleading innocence for the
death of Ajax! This plea was made to Telamon of Salamis,
before Salamis became Athenian, and is therefore entirely
irrelevant. The name Phreatto seems to be derived from φρέαρ,
φρέατος, which denoted an enclosed area of the sea near the
Peiraeus where the court sat.<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The origin of this court
belongs to the pollution era, but that fact does not prove that
its origin was very much later than that of the other courts,
if we regard these other courts as centres of official State
judicature functioning compulsorily under the influence of the
‘pollution’ religion. We maintain that there were courts for
homicide from time immemorial in tribal Greece. But it was
the seventh century that saw the birth of the Attic murder
courts in that particular rôle which they fulfilled, with some
slight modifications in respect of the distribution of labour in
historical times.</p>

<p>As we cannot then derive any assistance from the legends in
our attempt to describe the evolution of the Attic murder-courts,
we are compelled to begin, so to speak, at the other end,
and by arguing from survivals, to reconstruct the most probable
mode of evolution from an analysis of historical facts.</p>

<p>We will begin with the synoptic account of Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which
is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Areopagus</i> ‘judged (charges of) wilful murder and
wounding with intent to kill, arson and the administering of
drugs, if a person gives them with intent to kill.’ This account
is identical in fact with that of Dracon’s law, as Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
quotes it. It is therefore probably based upon the Demosthenic
passage or upon an archaic inscription. The clause φόνου
καὶ τραύματος ἐκ προνοίας καὶ πυρκαϊᾶς καὶ φαρμάκων occurs
both in Pollux and in Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Pollux adds that the
nine archons were added to the <i>Areopagites</i>, and that they held
their trials in the open air.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Palladium</i>: ‘in this court are heard charges of
involuntary slaying.’ Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> corrects this account,
though he is not himself very precise, when he says: ‘Murder-cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
are taken in this court ... in which are also tried cases
of manslaughter.’ Further details we shall presently adduce
from Aristotle and from Demosthenes; we shall see<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that this
court tried no murder-cases except those which occurred
between strangers.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Delphinium</i>: the trials in this court are modelled,
Pollux suggests, on that of Theseus and the Pallantidae ‘whom
he admitted that he slew but asserted that he had justly slain.’</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Prytaneum</i> ‘judges about those who have slain, if
they are unknown (ἀφανεῖς), and about inanimate objects which
have fallen upon and slain (persons). The Tribe-Kings, whose
duty it is to cast the fallen object over the (civic) boundaries,
preside over this court.’</p>

<p>(5) The Court at <i>Phreatto</i>: ‘in this court anyone was tried
who, being an exile for involuntary homicide, becomes liable
to a second charge of wilful murder. The Court was by the
sea; the accused had to make his defence from the ship,
without touching the land....’</p>

<p>Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> then proceeds to describe the <i>Heliastic</i> courts,
which were five or six in number. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> mentions four
of these courts, namely: (1) The Crush; (2) The Triangle;
(3) The Froggy and (4) The Scarlet. From this description of
them we may infer that these courts were always distinguished
in procedure if not in personnel from the famous Ephetae courts.
One of these Heliastic courts which Pollux mentions is the
court of the ‘Eleven’ Gaol-Commissioners. These officials had
summary jurisdiction in certain cases. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> mentions
the cases of ‘thieves, kidnappers and highway robbers’ who
confessed their guilt. Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> refers to a prison court
in which an accused but unconvicted murderer who was found
frequenting temples or public places could be summarily tried
and put to death. We shall discuss this court more fully
presently. It seems to us to be properly described as a special
kind of Heliastic court: for the Eleven were appointed, like
the ordinary Heliasts, by lot.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Whether the Heliastic jurors in the fourth century were
compelled to occupy separate places of jurisdiction from the
Ephetae or whether they also sat in the actual Ephetae courts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
is a difficult question to decide. One thing at least is certain,
as Lipsius points out.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The mode of procedure in the old
courts remained peculiar and distinct. When therefore
Antiphon<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> makes a pleader, in a homicide charge, object that
‘here there is no open-air trial, no customary giving and taking
of oaths,’ we know that the trial is by Heliastic jurors in a
Heliastic court. No mere change of personnel from that of the
Ephetae or nobles to that of democratic jurors was so drastic
as the legal sanction of an alternative procedure which entirely
lacked the religious traditional prestige of the older Ephetae
courts.</p>

<p>Aristotle’s account<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of the five great homicide courts is
very similar to that of Pollux:</p>

<p>(1) <i>The Areopagus</i>: Homicide with malice aforethought
(<i>i.e.</i> wilful murder) is tried in the Areopagus, wounding
with intent to kill,<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> poisoning with intent to kill, and arson:
these are the only indictments tried by the Areopagus.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Palladium</i>: Involuntary homicide, attempts to
commit homicide (βούλευσις), and the homicide of a slave,
or a foreigner domiciled or undomiciled, are tried in the
Palladium.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Delphinium</i>: Homicide avowed and alleged to be
lawful, as of a surprised adulterer, or in war of a friend mistaken
for an enemy, or of an antagonist in an athletic contest, is tried
in the Delphinium.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Prytaneum</i>: the King-Archon and the Tribe-Kings
judge indictments of inanimate objects and of animals.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Phreatto</i>: If an exile for involuntary homicide has not
yet obtained permission from the relatives of the deceased to
return, and is charged with another homicide or with wounding,
he is tried at Phreatto. He pleads from the deck of a vessel
brought to land.</p>

<p>Aristotle adds that ‘the jurors are appointed by lot, except
in the case of the Areopagus. The “King” (<i>i.e.</i> the King-Archon)
introduces indictments: the courts sit by night and
in the open air, and when the “King” takes his place in
any court, he lays aside his crown.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
homicide is unknown, the indictment is prosecuted in general
terms against the unknown author.’</p>

<p>In these extracts we must indicate some points of interest.
(1) The jurisdiction of the Areopagus, according to Poste’s
interpretation, extended only to cases in which human life
was actually taken, and deliberately taken: obviously therefore
it did not include all cases of arson. But according to
the usual interpretation, which we accept, arson of any kind
was included in its jurisdiction, and so was malicious wounding
which did not end in death. (2) In Aristotle’s account of
the Palladium, the word βούλευσις must mean ‘attempted
murder’ which did not succeed in inflicting any physical
injury.<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It cannot, as Lipsius<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> thinks, include ‘contriving
death,’ which, according to Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> was tried by the
Areopagus. (3) The Palladium adjudicated in cases of wilful
homicide between foreigners. Pausanias also attributes this
function to this court, as we have shown.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian Areopagus had a very chequered career.
Solon is generally regarded as its creator, and in his time it
functioned as a Council of State with very wide supervisory
powers. But about the year 460 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Ephialtes and Pericles<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
restricted the function of the Areopagus to the trial of wilful
murder, and of cases of arson and poisoning which included
actual intentional slaying. About the same time the archonship
was thrown open to the poorer citizens, so that the
personnel of the court became more democratic.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Pollux and
Aristotle agree in assigning to the Areopagus functions which it
continued to discharge, despite the vicissitudes of fortune, from
the sixth century onwards. When Aristotle says that the
Athenian jurors were appointed by lot,<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> he refers, clearly, to
the Heliastic courts and not to the Areopagus. The Areopagus
court, which was composed for the most part of Archons and
ex-Archons, was on quite a different plane. Similarly the
Ephetae judges were probably not chosen by lot, since they
were members of the old aristocracy of birth. Aristotle does
not expressly mention the Ephetae. Yet we cannot suppose
that they were ever completely deprived of jurisdiction in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
homicide cases. Harpocration<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> says that the jurors in all
the great homicide courts except the Areopagus were Ephetae;
that they were fifty-one in number, and were chosen according
to the qualification of birth. The statement of Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that
‘the Ephetae judged in the five courts’ applies only, we shall
see, to Dracon’s time. When he adds: ‘gradually the jurisdiction
of the Ephetae was regarded as a joke’ (κατεγελάσθη),
we can hardly suppose that he is comparing them with the
Areopagus, but rather with the Heliastic jurors. But he
implies at least that the Ephetae continued to function as
judges and that they were never confused with the Heliastic
jurors. If then in Aristotle’s time the judges at the Palladium,
Delphinium and Phreatto are Heliasts, we must conclude
not that the Ephetae had ceased to exist, but that democracy
had invaded their jurisdiction to the extent of permitting an
option in the personnel of the court, though the traditional
procedure of the court was maintained. We shall see that
the Areopagus and the four Ephetae courts were regarded with
reverential awe in the time of Demosthenes. We do not know
to what period Pollux refers when he says that ‘the court of
the Ephetae was regarded as a joke.’ It is probable that the
Heliasts had the option of sitting in such courts, and this
fact may have preserved for them at least a remnant of their
old prestige. But the main cause of the reverence which
these courts inspired was their traditional procedure. The
King-Archon when he presided at the Areopagus laid aside
his crown.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> According to our interpretation of Aristotle, he
also laid aside his crown when he sat amongst the Heliastic
jurors in the Ephetae courts. This act was not a tribute paid
by obsolete monarchy or aristocracy to victorious democracy.
It was an act which the religious atmosphere of the Areopagus
and of the Ephetae courts had enshrined in traditional custom.
It was an act which fully harmonised with the solemn
procedure of these courts, with their traditional nocturnal
sessions, in the open air, beneath the dark sky and the cold
stars.</p>

<p>We will now quote some extracts from Demosthenes in
relation to the Athenian homicide-courts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>(1) <i>The Areopagus.</i><a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> ‘There are many institutions
amongst us of a character not elsewhere found, but the most
characteristic and venerable of all is the court of the Areopagus
... in ancient times, as tradition tells us, the gods deigned
in this court alone to demand and to render justice for murder
and to sit and judge mutual disputes: Poseidon sued Ares for
having slain his son Halirrhothius,<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and the twelve gods judge
the suit of the Erinnyes and of Orestes: this tribunal neither
tyrant nor oligarchy nor democracy has ventured to deprive
of its jurisdiction in murder cases: everyone knows that any
process of popular invention would be less efficacious than that
of the Areopagus ... of this court only is it true that no
convicted criminal or defeated plaintiff has ever assailed the
propriety of its verdict. For all know that in the Areopagus
where the law permits and commands proceedings for homicide
to be taken, the person who charges another with such a crime
will take an oath with imprecations on his family and his house:
it is no ordinary oath that he has to swear ... he must stand
upon the entrails of a boar and a ram and a bull: these animals
must have been sacrificed by the proper persons and on the
appointed days so that both in regard to time and to officiating
persons every due solemnity may have been observed. Even
then the person who has sworn such an oath is not yet believed,
but if he is convicted of falsehood, he will carry away the curse
of perjury upon his children and his posterity.’ The solemn
procedure here described is also referred to by Antiphon<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>: and
Lysias<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> assures us that ‘the plaintiff swears that the defendant
was the slayer, the defendant swears that he did not slay.’
Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> states that both plaintiff and defendant were required
to confine themselves to the point at issue and to abstain from any
attempt to excite sympathy or compassion. What a contrast
this picture presents to the procedure in a democratic Heliastic
court composed of five hundred or seven hundred Athenian
citizens, sitting together at the <i>Crush</i>, at the <i>Triangle</i>, at the
<i>Froggy</i> or at the <i>Scarlet</i>!<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> When Demosthenes says that the
Areopagus was never deprived of its jurisdiction on homicide,
not even by the democracy, we feel that he is acutely conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
of the contrast in the procedure of the Areopagus and of the
Heliastic courts, as Antiphon certainly is<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>: we may also infer
that some such democratic invasion had occurred in the case
of the four other homicide courts in which the Ephetae at one
time had exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Palladium</i><a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>—the court for involuntary homicide:
‘here it is the law that both parties should first take oath
(διωμοσία), then deliver their speeches, and finally that the
court should decide.’ Demosthenes gives no further details,
but the missing information is supplied by Aristotle and by
Pausanias. We shall see presently<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that at one period this
court probably tried all kinds of homicide pleas between
citizens. The legend<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> concerning Demophon’s plea at this
court must have originated at such a period. But the court
had developed, we think, before the time of Solon a specialised
function in regard to pleas of involuntary homicide. The
reason for this was, perhaps, because it was situated outside
the city boundary and would naturally therefore have been
selected as a court of appeal by exiles who had been convicted
of manslaughter and who were anxious to return. Hence in
Solon’s time this court was habitually appealed to by the
citizens in charges of manslaughter. If it still continued to
hear pleas of wilful murder between foreigners, this was perhaps
because such pleas were regarded as of minor importance. In
such cases no Athenian court could decree or execute the
penalty of confiscation, since the slayers were foreigners, and
their property was not subject to Athenian control. It is also
possible that the laws of extradition (ἀνδροληψία) made it
desirable to judge cases of homicide between foreigners
at a court which was outside the original boundary of the
city.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Delphinium</i><a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>: ‘There is a third tribunal, of all
courts the most sacred and filled with awe, in which a person
acknowledges that he has slain another but contends that he has
done it lawfully. This is the court at the Delphinium. It
appears to me, men of Athens, that they who originally
distinguished the lawful from the unlawful inquired whether
it was right to consider no homicide lawful, or whether a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
kind of homicide must be considered lawful.... Considering
then that Orestes who admitted that he slew his mother was
acquitted by a tribunal of gods, they decided that some kinds
of homicide were justifiable.... Having come to that decision
they defined in precise terms the circumstances in which it was
lawful to kill.’ What a halo of sanctity still seems to surround
this Delphinium court! In ancient societies it was much
less difficult to ascertain the identity of a slayer than it was to
define the boundaries of righteous and unrighteous slaying.
But once the boundary lines were fixed, and we have seen<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> how
they were fixed by a law of Dracon, the judgment resolved
itself into a question of facts. Apart from religion, however,
facts may be obscured by perjury. Hence it was probably the
religious atmosphere of the court, and also its procedure,
which was consecrated by long tradition, that caused the
verdicts of the court to be revered and respected.</p>

<p>We may ask whether, in the event of a verdict for the
defendant (the accuser), this court could have condemned the
vanquished plaintiff to death? We agree with Lipsius<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that
theoretically it could have done so. In practice, however, it
rarely did so, because the Archon Basileus must have previously
estimated the balance of guilt in favour of the plaintiff
(accused), and if he were vanquished at the Delphinium it was
probably open to him to advance a further plea of manslaughter
in the Palladium. The real meaning of a verdict of this
court against the plaintiff was an imputation of some degree
of homicide guilt, not necessarily the full guilt of wilful
murder.</p>

<p>The attempt<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> to connect Orestes with the institution of
this court is very interesting, but it is not successful. If it was
the Areopagus which really acquitted Orestes, why did the
Athenians set up a new court for such pleas? If it was the
Delphinium, then why did legend connect him with the
Areopagus? According to one account it was the gods who
acquitted Orestes,<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> yet it was open to Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> to represent
him as acquitted by Athenian citizens! It is important,
however, in view of our subsequent analysis of the Oresteian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
legend in Attic tragedy, to note that according to at least one
form of the legend, it was on a plea of justifiable matricide that
Orestes was tried and acquitted. Though Plato<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> says that
in no circumstances was it lawful to kill one’s parent, yet Plato
would admit, we have no doubt, that the command of Apollo
constituted an extenuation if not a justification for such a deed,
in the days of private vengeance. But the connexion of
Orestes with two different courts suggests a variation in the
legends of Orestes, for it is unlikely that the same legend would
have represented him as having been prosecuted before both
courts on the same charge.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Prytaneum</i><a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>: ‘If a stone or a piece of wood or iron
or anything of the kind falls and strikes a person, and we are
ignorant who threw it but know and have in our possession the
instrument of death, proceedings are taken against such instruments
here.’ Demosthenes does not mention animals, but
Aristotle supplies this deficiency.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It is strange to speak of an
object ‘falling and striking’ and at the same time to assume
that somebody threw it. We have already suggested<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that
even if the thrower was known, proceedings could still be taken
against the object if the thrower could swear that he did not
intend to kill any person. Is it not probable that the weapon
by which a person was accidentally slain in war or at gymnastic
exercises, or the weapon by which a person was deliberately
but justifiably slain, according to the Draconian law, would,
after the slayer’s acquittal at the Delphinium, be tried and found
guilty here?</p>

<p>(5) <i>At Phreatto</i><a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>: ‘There is yet a fifth court ... that in
Phreatto. Here, men of Athens, the law requires a person to
be tried if one is in exile on account of involuntary homicide
and if, before those who procured his banishment have accepted
“appeasement” from him, he incurs another charge, this
time, of wilful murder. The framer of these laws did not
overlook the criminal’s case because it was impossible for him
to come to Athens, nor did he take the charge against him
for granted because he had done some such act before. He
devised a means by which religion was not outraged and the
criminal was not deprived of a hearing and a trial.... He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
brought the judges to a spot to which the criminal might
come, appointing a certain place in Attica by the sea. The
accused sails up in a ship and pleads without touching the land:
the judges hear him and give their verdict on the shore: if
found guilty, he suffers the penalty of wilful murder, quite
justly: if acquitted, he escapes that penalty but continues
to serve the exile decreed for his previous manslaughter.’
The influence of the pollution doctrine in the origin of this
court is quite manifest. The contingency which is thus
provided for was, no doubt, very rare, but it was not nevertheless
ignored. The ‘framer of the laws’ here referred to
is, of course, Dracon, but we think that the court may have
existed for some years before his time. The seventh century
is, however, the most probable date of its origin. In view
of the facts narrated in this quotation it is difficult to understand
how scholars can believe that ‘private settlement’ was
legal even for manslaughter.<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The theoretical power of
the relatives of the slain to resist ‘appeasement’ as long as
they wished is here most clearly indicated.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The procedure
here described might, we think, apply to homicide which at
first was adjudged involuntary but which came, in the light
of later evidence, to be considered voluntary. The penalty
of wilful murder here referred to is perpetual exile and confiscation
of property. In the event of the slayer choosing
to land, he could be arrested and delivered to the ‘Eleven’
for execution; hence it is clear that the verdict of this court
involved, <i>en rupture de ban</i>, the penalty of death. Plato was
probably thinking of this court when he decrees<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> that a
murder exile who is cast by a storm upon the coast of forbidden
territory may put up a tent in the water and must
keep his feet in the water till he finds an opportunity for
resuming his voyage!</p>

<p>In a continuation of this same passage Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
refers to a sixth legal process, involving, so to speak, a possible
sixth homicide-court, which we have already<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> identified
with the Prison court of ‘the Eleven,’ a special Heliastic court
of summary jurisdiction. Demosthenes says: ‘If a man is
ignorant of all the other legal courses, or if the time within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
which they must be followed has gone by, or if for any reason
whatever he does not choose to adopt those (other) methods
of prosecution, and sees the homicide walking about in the
temples or in the market-place, it is lawful for him to “arrest”
and bring the murderer to prison ... and when he is brought
to prison, he will suffer no punishment till he is tried, but if he
is found guilty, he will be punished with death: if however
the person who arrested him does not get a fifth part of the
votes, he will pay a fine of 1000 drachmae.’ Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> says
of the Eleven Gaol commissioners: ‘Their duties are to have
charge of prisoners, to put to death all thieves, kidnappers
and highway robbers if they confess their guilt, to bring them
before the Heliasts if they plead not guilty, to discharge them
if acquitted, to put them to death if convicted.’ Demosthenes
clearly does not refer to a convicted murderer <i>en rupture de
ban</i>. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> is right in rejecting this possible interpretation
of the passage. By a law of Dracon<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> a convicted murderer
<i>en rupture de ban</i> could be put to death by the first person
who met him or taken to the ‘Eleven’ for execution, without
further trial. But Demosthenes suggests that the ‘Eleven’
could try a murderer and condemn him to death! Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
assures us that ‘the Eleven’ sat as a Heliastic court. But
could they try cases of homicide? Was prosecution open to
any citizen? Was there at Athens a γραφὴ φόνου?</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Question of a γραφὴ φόνου</span></h4>

<p>Glotz answers the question in the negative. But Pollux
says<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that there was a γραφὴ or public indictment for
wilful murder, for malicious wounding, for arson, and for
poisoning, as well as for adultery, sacrilege and impiety. The
Heliasts were the normal judges for indictments (γραφαί),
though Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> thinks that indictments could be also
brought before the Areopagus. Was it then possible for
any citizen to indict a murderer before the Heliasts in the
time of Demosthenes? If so, what becomes of the law of
Dracon which prescribed prosecution by the relatives?
Glotz says<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>: ‘Si Solon avait imaginé une γραφὴ de ce genre,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
il eût par là-même ruiné la loi de Dracon sur un point essentiel.’
Caillemer finds it difficult to solve the question. He says<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>:
‘La question est malaisée à résoudre et très controversée
parce que les textes sont contradictoires ou obscurs ... l’institution
par Solon d’une véritable φόνου γραφή, la concession
à tous les citoyens du droit d’intenter une action d’homicide,
pouvait-elle se concilier avec le principe même de la loi de
Dracon? Lorsque les plus proches des parents du défunt
étaient d’accord pour pardonner ou pour transiger, les parents
plus éloignés n’avaient pas le droit de poursuivre le meurtrier
devant les tribunaux.’ He concludes, however: ‘en fait,
dans beaucoup de cas, on pouvait arriver à la répression du
meurtre par d’autres voies. Certains homicides donnaient
certainement ouverture à l’εἰσαγγελία et cette procédure
permettait d’atteindre un coupable que la loi de Dracon aurait
laissé impuni.’</p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> that Socrates objected to Euthyphro’s
prosecution of his father on the ground that he was not a
relative of the slain man. Yet Euthyphro began his prosecution
nevertheless! He calls his charge a δίκη, not a γραφὴ.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
He is consulting the King Archon at the Prytaneum. We
have quoted from Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> a law mentioned by the
Exegetae, to the effect that it was not permitted to anyone
save a relative of the victim, or a master, if the victim was
a slave, to prosecute for homicide. Yet the Exegetae advised
the plaintiff on independent grounds. ‘As you were not
present yourself, but only your wife and children, and you
have no other witnesses, we recommend you not to make
proclamation of anyone by name, but only in general against
the guilty parties, and further not to begin proceedings before
the Archon Basileus.... Our advice is that you perform
the necessary religious ceremonies for yourself and your house,
bear the misfortune as patiently as you can, and take vengeance
if you like in some other way.’ The religious ceremonies
mentioned in this passage were probably an expiation-offering
to the ghost of the nurse who had been slain. If so, then
the Erinnys of the dead, at least, accepted the Draconian law!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Is it possible—it cannot of course be certain—that the ‘other
way’ of avenging was by a γραφὴ? If this indictment could
not be brought till a number of years had passed, is this the
reason that the misfortune had to be borne with patience?</p>

<p>We have referred to a Demosthenic passage<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in which
an unsuccessful γραφὴ ἀσεβείας was brought against the
uncle of a man who was alleged to be guilty of parricide. If
the charge succeeded, the alleged parricide, Diodorus, assures
us that he would have been put to death and that his property
would have been confiscated. But there is no reference to
a specific trial for parricide. Did the γραφὴ ἀσεβείας involve,
indirectly, a γραφὴ φόνου?</p>

<p>We believe that there was not, at Athens, a γραφὴ φόνου,
that is, a direct indictment of a murderer by any citizen who
wished to charge him. The suit which Euthyphro brought
against his father was a δίκη, which was a quasi-civil or quasi-private
process, and in any case the Archon Basileus would,
we feel sure, have refused to accept it. But we think that
an indictment for impiety, which could be brought by any
citizen against a relative of a slain man who had failed to
‘proclaim’ and to prosecute the slayer, involved, if successful,
a verdict of murder against the slayer; and that it was
the possibility of such indictments which led Pollux to use
the expression γραφαὶ φόνου. Thus if an indictment for
impiety had been brought against a relative of the nurse whose
violent death is referred to in the speech of Demosthenes
<i>against Euergus</i>, it would have involved a verdict of murder
or of manslaughter against Euergus and Theophemus. This
is probably the ‘other way’ which was referred to in the
speech by the Exegetae.</p>

<p>How then do we explain the Demosthenic passage<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> with
which we began our present inquiry? The essential points
in this passage are, we think, the reference to the murderer
as actually ‘walking about in the temples or in the market-place,’
and the implication that he was ‘proclaimed’ but
untried and unconvicted. Assuming that the relatives of the
slain had proclaimed the slayer but had not proceeded with
the prosecution, we can understand why the normal procedure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
of homicide-prosecution could not have been applied. For
the relatives of the slain alone had the right of direct prosecution.
But if the murderer had been proclaimed, but was,
for some reason, untried and unconvicted, he could, if he
frequented the temples or public places, have been proceeded
against directly by a γραφὴ ἀσεβείας—an indictment for
impiety. For the validity of such an indictment it was
necessary that he should have been formally proclaimed
as a slayer by the relatives of the slain: for, otherwise, he
could not be regarded as publicly ‘polluted.’ But if we assume
that he was proclaimed, and that afterwards—either because
of lack of evidence, or because the proper time had passed by,
or simply because the relatives of the slain were indifferent
(we may suppose that they were bribed by a ‘private settlement’)—he
proceeded to act as if he had not been proclaimed,
then it was open to any citizen to indict the proclaimed
homicide for impiety, but only if he was found in the temples
or the market-place. The result of a successful indictment of
this kind would have been more severe than that of a successful
murder-charge: for though the slayer could have saved his
property, he would not have been permitted to go into perpetual
banishment, but he would have been put to death.</p>

<p>It is therefore, we think, a γραφὴ ἀσεβείας to which
Demosthenes in this passage refers. Such an indictment
would have been in practice but not in theory an indictment
for murder. In theory it was an indictment for impiety or
sacrilege. To win the indictment it was not necessary that
the plaintiff should prove that the defendant was a murderer.
For a proclaimed murderer had to prove his innocence.
Hence, normally, a proclaimed murderer would either have
challenged a verdict immediately after accusation, or he would
have fled into exile. Thus, once more, we observe that ‘private
settlement’ was not only illegal but was dangerously so. If
the slayer settled with the relatives of the slain, they could
have been indicted; and if he frequented the temples or the
market-place, he himself could have been indicted for impiety.
But if he was not proclaimed by the relatives of the slain,
they alone could have been indicted for impiety: yet an
adverse verdict would have involved his condemnation. Such
is our solution of this difficult problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>Whether this indictment against a proclaimed murderer
who had been found in a temple or a public place was brought
before ‘the Eleven’ for final judgment, or whether it was referred
by them, if the accused denied the charge, to the ordinary
Heliastic courts, is a question which we cannot decide.
Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> includes ‘the Eleven’ amongst the Heliastic judges,
but Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> implies that they could only judge when the
accused pleaded guilty. If it sounds strange to say that
gaol commissioners might have heard such indictments, it
is, we think, not quite so strange as the fact indicated by
Philippi,<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that indictments for impiety were in certain
cases heard by judges who had no other judicial qualification
save the fact that they had been initiated at the mysteries
of Eleusis! The passage in Andocides,<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> on which Philippi’s
statement is based, certainly suggests that there were at
Athens special religious or ecclesiastical courts for the trial
of offences connected with ritualistic procedure, such as profane
conduct or the divulging of religious secrets. The court
which is described by Andocides consisted of initiated citizens,
and the accusation was concerned with an offence in regard
to the Mysteries. Were these citizen courts a democratic
development of the Eumolpid Exegetae courts which are
referred to by Lysias?<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Very probably they were, just as
the Heliasts were a democratic development of the Ephetae
courts. In both cases, however, we must assume that the
development did not involve the destruction of the older
system of judicature, but merely reformed it by providing
an option in the personnel, while retaining the traditional
procedure of the court.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Origin and Evolution of Attic Homicide Courts</span></h4>

<p>Having now set forth the most important features of the
homicide-judicature of Athens in the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it
remains to inquire what inferences may be drawn from these
features as to the origin and the evolution of these courts.
Our views as to the general origin of the Attic courts have
already been indicated.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The theory of Gilbert and of Köhler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
that these courts originated in the right of sanctuary we have
rejected as improbable.<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The court at Phreatto had no
connexion with a temple. Neither had the Prytaneum. The
temple of Athene Areia on the Areopagus may not have existed
when the hill first became famed for its legal judgments. The
Palladium and the Delphinium were both temple courts, and
during the Dark Ages (900-750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) the right of sanctuary
may have given to these places their first connexion with
homicide-investigation. This is, however, an accidental matter.
The real cause of the birth of the Attic murder courts was the
concurrence of the doctrine of homicide-pollution with the
political synoekism of States in the eighth and seventh centuries
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Some Attic courts may have functioned in an arbitrary
manner for local offences in earlier times, but their historical
rôle began, and some of them, like Phreatto, were born, in the
seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dracon and the Ephetae</span></h4>

<p>Was it then Dracon who established the Ephetae courts
as Solon established the Heliastic courts? Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> finds
it difficult to decide this question. ‘Whether Dracon himself,’
he says, ‘introduced or merely codified, in accordance with
customs already existing, the system by which murder cases
were tried at Athens and which, even measured by the standard
of to-day, is tolerably complete, can as little be decided with
certainty as can the question whether he was the founder of
the five different courts at which in later times the trial was
held according to the nature of the case.’ Yet, a few lines
previously<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Gilbert decides the latter question in the affirmative.
‘Dracon,’ he says, ‘transferred the judicial powers
which the Areopagus had previously possessed to two new
bodies which he created, the Ephetae and the Prytaneis.’</p>

<p>This question, for many scholars, has turned on the interpretation
of a passage in Pollux,<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> who wrote eight hundred
years after the event. Pollux says of the Ephetae that they
were fifty-one in number and that ‘Dracon established them,
chosen on grounds of birth. They were the judges of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
accused of bloodshed in the five courts. It was Solon who
established in addition the council of the Areopagus.’</p>

<p>Philippi was the first to question the value of this evidence.
As the phrase ‘chosen on grounds of birth’ occurs in a law
of Dracon which mentioned the Ephetae, Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> thinks
that Pollux is arguing from a false interpretation of that law,
suggested by a false reading τούτοις for τούτους in the law
as quoted by Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> As the verb αἱρείσθων may
have a ‘middle’ or a ‘passive’ meaning, the sentence τούτοις
δ’ οἱ πεντήκοντα καὶ εἶς ἀριστίνδην αἱρείσθων may be translated
‘for these (<i>i.e.</i> the phrateres) let the fifty-one be chosen
according to birth’: instead of: ‘these phrateres (τούτους) let
the fifty-one choose according to birth.’ But the Demosthenic
citation of the law contains a reference two lines earlier to
an existing body of fifty-one judges of the plea of involuntary
homicide, and, therefore, the reading τούτοις is obviously false.</p>

<p>Gilbert says<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that this supposition of Philippi is ‘possible
but not necessary.’ But it seems obvious from the law as
cited that the supposition is fanciful and impossible. Yet we
hold that Pollux was in error in asserting that Dracon instituted
the Ephetae. The reason for the error has been correctly
indicated by Müller.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> ‘This title (Ephetae),’ he says,
‘occurred so frequently in Dracon’s laws that it gave rise to
the opinion which we find in Pollux that Dracon instituted
the college of the Ephetae.’ We may add that in the laws of
Dracon there is no suggestion of the creation of homicide-judges
or of homicide-courts. Their existence is presumed,
just as clearly as the distinction between grades of homicide-guilt
and the details of the various penalties are presumed.
Dracon, in our view, merely codified existing laws in relation
to homicide, and allotted the trials of the different kinds of
homicide to the tribe-kings, on the one hand, and to the fifty-one
Ephetae, on the other. This conclusion will be confirmed
by a consideration of the meaning of the word Ephetae.</p>

<p>Müller<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> rightly points out that the ending της normally
has an active signification. The word ἐφέτης (we will assume
for the moment that the plural form ἐφέται had a corresponding
singular form) should not, says Müller, denote ‘a person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
appealed to,’ but rather a person who permits an avenger to
punish. Müller thus connects the word with the verb ἐφίημι,
‘I permit,’ rather than with the term ἔφεσις, meaning ‘appeal.’
Schömann<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> also connect the word with ἐφίημι,
but interpret the verb as an archaic form, which means ‘I
direct’ persons as to the manner in which the accused should
be punished or proceeded against. The Ephetae, according
to this view, are ‘the directors’ or the determining arbiters
of prosecution or vengeance. Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> points out that this
opinion gives to the term too wide and general a meaning.
We agree with this criticism. Any judge or group of judges
could have been called ‘Ephetae,’ according to this view. Why,
then, we may ask, did not Dracon call these judges by the
ordinary title of homicide judges, namely, dicasts (δικασταί)?
Such was the usual title of the democratic Heliastic judges.</p>

<p>Lange, who at a later period came to favour the
Schömann-Gilbert view, originally proposed<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that the term
Ephetae was an abbreviated clause, that the words οἱ ἐφέται
are derived from the phrase οἱ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔταις ὄντες, <i>i.e.</i>
‘those who presided over the citizens of full right’—the
foremen or heads of the old aristocracy of tribal Attica.
Philippi<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> favours the original theory of Lange, which is,
he says, ‘so excellent from a linguistic point of view that I
am entirely satisfied.’ Philippi points out that, according
to this view, the Ephetae are the Athenian counterpart of the
Spartan Gerousia and that therefore we can understand their
selection on grounds of birth. Glotz<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> also adopts this
interpretation. He speaks of ‘les éphètes ou chefs d’ἔται.’
Now, the Homeric word ἔται may mean either cousins or
comrades. It was a word which could denote, in Pelasgian
life, members of the same clan or of the same phratry. The
chiefs of the phratries were therefore nobles, closely connected
with the kings of the tribes. It is therefore significant that
the only homicide judges who are mentioned in the Draconian
inscription of 409-8 are the kings and the Ephetae.</p>

<p>Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> assures us that, in the time of Dracon, the Ephetae
sat in all the five great homicide courts. They therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
sat on the Areopagus at that time, and also in the Prytaneum.
In the time of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the judges at the Prytaneum court
were the Tribe-Kings and the King-Archon. The Ephetae
continued to sit at the Delphinium, the Palladium, and the
Phreatto courts.<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> These facts suggest, <i>prima facie</i>, a survival
in the democratic era of the judicial power of the old
nobility of birth. Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> states that the Tribe-Kings were
Eupatridae, which implies that they were members of the
old Attic nobility. The Ephetae, he says,<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> were chosen on
grounds of birth: a fact which proves, as Gilbert points out,<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
that they also were Eupatridae. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> says that,
before Dracon, the highest magistrates were elected from the
ranks of the aristocrats and the oligarchs; and that these
magistrates were the final judges of the suits that came
before them, not, as in his own time, the preliminary investigators.</p>

<p>Is it not obvious therefore that we must interpret the
evolution of Attic homicide courts as a gradual encroachment
on the part of the new plutocracy and the new democracy
upon the domain which at one time was administered
exclusively by the sacerdotal aristocracy of birth? According
to this view, the Ephetae and the Tribe-Kings, who once
sat in all the great Attic courts and who were never suppressed,
though they certainly were submerged, in the classical period
of Greek history, were the lineal descendants of the tribal
Elders of Pelasgian days whom Homer describes<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> as ‘sitting
on smooth stones in a sacred circle, with sceptres in their
hands.’ According to this hypothesis Dracon did not create
the Athenian Ephetae. He did not even establish them in
the rôle of homicide judges, for such they had been from time
immemorial, in the local judicature of tribal society; and
such they must also have been, in the centralised civic judicature,
which before Dracon, though perhaps not long before
him, had evolved under the twofold influence of political
synoekism and the religious doctrine of homicide as a
‘pollution.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Exegetae and the Number Fifty-one</span></h4>

<p>We have frequently<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> referred to the Ephetae in connection
with the Exegetae or Interpreters, and we have described
both these groups as a sacerdotal nobility. We must now
attempt to explain this connection, and, incidentally, discuss
the origin of the curiously constant number ‘fifty-one,’ which
is usually associated with the Ephetae. According to Suidas,<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
the Exegetae or Interpreters were appointed or controlled
by the oracle at Delphi and they were three in number.
Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> defines the Exegetae as ‘those who gave information
regarding omens and other sacred matters.’ But the
Tribe-Kings, as Pollux states,<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> were also concerned with
‘sacred matters’: and so, therefore, probably, were the
Ephetae. Now Demosthenes does not mention the number
three in connexion with the Exegetae. Neither does Plato.
Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> states that the Eupatridae of Athens were the
Exegetae of sacred law. This statement implies that the
Exegetae were a widespread caste rather than a group of three
individuals. Similarly Lysias<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> refers to the Eumolpidae
of Eleusis as the Exegetae of unwritten customs.</p>

<p>Taking it for granted that the Athenian Interpreters were
three in number, Gilbert<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and Schömann explain the number
fifty-one, which is applied by Dracon to the Ephetae, as composed
of forty-eight Ephetae (elected by the four Ionian tribes
of Attica, twelve from each tribe) and of three Exegetae.
According to this view, there was in Dracon’s time no distinction
between the Exegetae as Interpreters and the Exegetae
as homicide-judges. Müller,<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> however, thinks that the
three Exegetae were not judges, but only purifiers; and he
explains the number fifty-one as a Cleisthenic or post-Cleisthenic
figure, made up of, say, five members from each
of the ten Cleisthenic tribes, and one additional judge, who
was presumably the King-Archon.<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But, we may point
out, the number fifty-one occurs in the actual (unrestored)
Draconian inscription<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of the year 409-8 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>: and it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
improbable that any changes were made in the law in the time
of Cleisthenes.</p>

<p>Plato says<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> that the Interpreters, in his ideal State,
should be elected annually <i>one</i> from each tribe. It is therefore
better, we think, to abandon the hypothesis that the
Exegetae were at all times three in number. Suidas is a very
late authority for this number, and he may be referring merely
to the chief members of a group. But how, then, do we explain
the fact that the number of the Ephetae was invariably fifty-one?
It is, we think, very possible to suppose that in early
times the three most important ‘archons’ were Ephetae,
who acted in conjunction with the other Ephetae, who were
therefore forty-eight in number, and that the number forty-eight
was made up of the four Tribe-Kings and of forty-four
nobles elected by the four Ionian Attic tribes, eleven from
each tribe. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> assures us that the three ‘archons’
in the seventh century were nobles and that they were ‘final
judges,’ not mere investigators. It is not necessary to
assume that in later times the Ephetae always sat together
as a body of fifty-one judges. Sometimes they may have
adjudicated as a single group, but more frequently they were
divided into sections which sat in different courts. The
presence of the King Archon and the Tribe-Kings at the
Prytaneum<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> suggests perhaps a previous condition of things
in which these officials sat with the entire Ephetae body in
the more important homicide courts.</p>

<p>We prefer therefore to suppose that the Ephetae and the
Exegetae were for a long time<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> identical. They were both
members of a sacerdotal nobility of birth which preserved
the oral traditions of tribal law, and expounded these traditions.
As these nobles normally supervised the ritual of public sacrifices,
they naturally also, after the advent of the pollution
doctrine, acquired control of the ceremonial of homicide
purgation. Thus, Müller says<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>: ‘The purification of the
bloodshedder came under the sacred law of Athens which
remained in the hands of the old nobility even after they had
lost their political authority.’ The number <i>three</i> applied,
apparently, in Müller’s view,<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> to the three chief purifiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
or supervisors of the rite of purgation, though Müller is not
quite explicit on this matter. But we cannot suppose that
this figure limited the number of purifiers at any time.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Solon and the Areopagus</span></h4>

<p>In regard to the question of the Solonian origin of the
Areopagus, Gilbert, arguing from Aristotle’s account, holds<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
that the Council of the Areopagus was in existence even before
Dracon’s time. ‘The great powers,’ he says, ‘which the
Council of the Areopagus possessed in the government before
Dracon were considerably curtailed by him ... for whereas
the Areopagus before Dracon ... exercised judicial functions
... so long as Dracon’s constitution lasted, that council was
merely the guardian of the laws and superintended the magistrates.
Dracon transferred the judicial powers which the
Areopagus previously possessed to the Ephetae and the
Prytaneis.’ This account exceeds, we think, the limits of
legitimate inference from the text of Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> We cannot
even be sure that the text of Aristotle is trustworthy. The
Athenians did not possess any accurate evidence in regard to
their early institutions. Müller<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> rejects the view (which is
also held by Schömann)<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> that Dracon interfered with the
judicial functions of the Areopagus. Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> states definitely
that Solon added the Council of the Areopagus to the already
existing Ephetae courts. Gilbert regards this statement as a
confirmation of his theory that Dracon created the jurisdiction
of the Ephetae. We think it is rather a refutation of it.
Plutarch apparently did not believe that an Areopagus court,
as distinct from the Ephetae, existed before Solon’s time: for
he thinks<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> that a so-called law of Solon which referred to
persons ‘condemned by the Areopagus, by the Ephetae, or, in
the Prytaneum by the Kings,’ should have read ‘those condemned
for such offences as (now) belong to the Areopagites.’</p>

<p>We believe that there was a Council of State which was also
a State court, connected with the Hill of Ares (or Areopagus),
in Dracon’s time and even before it—but that it was not then
distinguished from the Ephetae who, like the Spartan Gerousia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
were the supreme Council of the State. When Pollux says
that Solon added the council of the Areopagus to the Ephetae,
he is not quite accurate. What he should have said—perhaps
what he meant to say—was that Solon established a new
Areopagus as distinct from what we may call the older Ephetae-Areopagus,
and that he gave to this new body judicial and
administrative functions. The error of Gilbert (and of Aristotle)
lies in their failure to distinguish between the personnel of the
old Council and that of the new Council. The old Council was
composed exclusively of the old nobility, that is to say, of the
Ephetae. It was a select group, within the Ephetae caste, a
group, for instance, of nobles who had held executive power.
The new Council which Solon created was composed of ex-‘archons’
or ex-magistrates, but the basis on which these
‘archons’ were chosen was essentially different from that on
which the Ephetae were chosen. For wealth, not birth, was
the qualification which was necessary for the office.</p>

<p>The motive which induced Solon to establish this new
Areopagus Council was probably his desire to set up a plutocratic
body, surrounded by a halo of sanctity derived from the
traditions of the older Ephetae-Areopagus, which would act as
a check on the increasing power of a more democratic Council,
which Aristotle also mentions, namely the Draconian Senate of
400 (or 401) which was appointed, by lot, from the ranks of all
‘citizens.’<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> It was, we think, this democratic council, or
Senate, which threatened most seriously the power of the
aristocracy. The wide powers of supervision which the
Ephetae-Areopagus possessed were, of course, a valuable
possession, but, with the growth of the Senate, the legislative
and executive powers, and perhaps even the judicial powers,
of the old Council of Noble Elders were endangered. Hence
Solon, who was neither a democrat nor an aristocrat, but who
was, as we conceive him, a plutocrat, instituted a new plutocratic
Areopagus at the expense of the Ephetae on the one hand and
of the Draconian Senate on the other. Though he allowed an
appellant jurisdiction to the popular Heliastic jurors,<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> the
normal homicide jurisdiction remained attached to the court of
the Areopagus even though its personnel was now changed, just
as in later times it continued attached to the ‘Ephetae’ courts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
when the Heliasts acquired the privilege of sitting there. The
explanation of this strange fact is to be found in the religious
doctrine of homicide as a ‘pollution.’ In these five courts
alone—the fact that one of them was now a Council does not
matter—were homicide trials held at night, in the open air,
solemn oaths and imprecations were sworn, and the King-Archon
sat without his crown. Solon, then, did not create the
court of the Areopagus: he merely changed the personnel of
the court. The Ephetae, that is, the nobles, were no longer the
judges in that court. According to the literal interpretation of
Pollux, we might conclude that there existed in Solon’s time
<i>six</i> Athenian homicide courts. But Pollux must have been
well aware that the Ephetae (including the Tribe Kings) from
Solon’s time onwards functioned only at the four minor courts,
which were known as the Delphinium, the Palladium, the
Prytaneum, and the court at Phreatto.</p>

<p>Why then, we may ask, did Solon select the Areopagus as
the court in which the Ephetae were compelled to give place to
plutocratic ex-archons, and why was the jurisdiction of that
court, now perhaps for the first time, limited to cases of homicide
‘with malice aforethought’? Müller<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> offers a solution
of this problem. ‘The administration,’ he says, ‘of the rites
of expiation could not be taken away from the old aristocracy
of Athens even when the constitution underwent in other
respects a complete change. None but an aristocratic court
was competent to pronounce an act of homicide expiable, and
itself to preside over the rites of expiation and cleansing.
Accordingly, the cases reserved for the decision of that court
were those in which a person was accused of unpremeditated
slaying—for here expiation came in after the exile; further,
where the plea put in by the accused was that of justifiable
homicide—in this case there was no punishment ... but still
it was necessary, at least in certain cases, that he should undergo
purification: further, in case an unpremeditated was followed
by a premeditated act of homicide, it being then a question
whether expiation was admissible or not: lastly, the formalities
observed in trials of the weapon by which blood was shed ...
necessarily devolved upon the managers of the ancient rites of
expiation. As wilful murder, on the contrary, could not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
expiated ... there was no need in this case to refer to
expositors of ancient Sacred Law. So that Solon was at liberty
here to vest the cognisance of such cases in a corporate body
which ... he formed out of the most affluent Athenian
citizens who had filled the offices of archon.’</p>

<p>This hypothesis is very ingenious. We have little doubt
that there is a large substratum of correctness in its underlying
principle—namely the association of the old nobility with
‘purgation’ rites. But surely the court of Phreatto was not
based on the probability that purgation would have followed
the trial. Again, the Palladium frequently tried cases of wilful
murder between metics and between foreigners. These
murderers could never have been purged at Athens, since the
deed was committed there. Moreover, all these Ephetae
courts, except the Prytaneum, could, in all probability, have
brought in a verdict of wilful murder, just as the Areopagus
could have acquitted the defendant and admitted him therefore
to some kind of ‘purgation’ at the shrine of the Semnai
Theai. Furthermore, Müller is not quite consistent with
himself in associating purgation exclusively with judges as in
this quotation, and in maintaining elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> that the three
Exegetae who supervised those rites were not judges<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> at all.
By his own reasoning, therefore, he would be compelled to
admit that the Exegetae could have cleansed the accused after
acquittal in any court. Again, he holds<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> that in early Attica
there was no discrimination between murder and manslaughter,
and that the same courts originally tried all these different
pleas; but yet he maintains that a certain distribution of
functions which was based on this discrimination had already
taken place in the time of Solon.</p>

<p>We believe that a discrimination between different degrees
of homicide guilt was recognised in early tribal Attica, and
that in the seventh century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when a compromise took
place between what we may call Apollinism and tribalism,
the Apolline religion was compelled by tribal aristocracy to
define the kinds of homicide to which purgation could be
applied. Moreover, the detailed formulae and ritual of
purgation were confided as a secret and sacred trust to this
aristocracy. But even within an exclusive nobility there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
must eventually arise a division of labour. The same nobles
who judged a suit might also be appealed to for purgation,
and hence they probably found it more convenient to delegate
the latter duty to one particular family or clan. Most especially
would the Ephetae of the Areopagus, who in those days held
in their hands the reins of civic government, have found it
difficult to discharge at once the various duties of a Council
of State, of homicide judges, and of purgation priests. Hence,
therefore, we may assume that the Ephetae-Areopagus
limited its activities as a homicide-court and confined itself
to charges of wilful murder, of plots to kill, and perhaps also
of arson, between the citizens (who were, originally, the nobles),
not merely because of the necessity for a division of labour,
but also because the Areopagus court was the supreme Council
of the State. To the other courts, therefore, fell the duty of
trying minor homicide cases, and such cases as were more
likely to require purgation. Thus, wilful murder between
foreigners was comparatively a minor issue, and was no longer
tried by the Areopagus. Such cases were relegated to the
Palladium court, perhaps because it lay outside the city.<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
Again, charges of murder which were brought against a person
already convicted of manslaughter were naturally tried at
Phreatto, as such a slayer was not permitted to land in Attica.
It was in some such way as this, we think, that a traditional
custom had grown up in regard to the distribution of homicide
pleas among different courts in the time of Dracon and of Solon.
Solon made the Areopagus the basis for a reform which was
directed against the old nobility, partly because it was feasible
to introduce innovations into this court with the least possible
interference with existing religious traditions, but even more
so because the Ephetae-Areopagus was the keystone of the
fabric of aristocratic power. Here, despite the advancing
influence of the Senate of Four Hundred with its increasing
executive and administrative powers, the old nobility retained
the strongest outpost of authority in a court which, amidst
other privileges, possessed the right of final decision in matters
of life and death. This right of final decision was not a privilege
of the new Solonian Areopagus—it was transferred to the
popular Heliastic courts. The innovations of Pericles and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Ephialtes in 460 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> reduced the Areopagus almost to the
level of a simple homicide court<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>: yet its personnel, which
was composed of ex-archons, enabled it as a judicial body
to command general respect. But it was, nevertheless, the
traditions and the religious procedure of the court which
lifted it above the level of the Crush and the Triangle. This
theory, which we have propounded, of the origin and evolution
of the Areopagus is in perfect harmony with the statement of
Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> that: ‘neither tyranny nor oligarchy nor
democracy have ventured to deprive this tribunal of its jurisdiction
in murder.’ But Gilbert’s theory<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> of Draconian
interference with the judicial powers of the Areopagus is not
consistent with this statement. The opinion of Pollux<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
and of Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> that there was no Areopagus court before
the time of Solon contains at least an important element
of truth, since it may be taken to imply that the Areopagus
of historical times, the personnel of which was composed of
ex-archons, did not exist before the time of Solon. The pre-Solonian
Areopagus was not in our opinion really distinguishable
from the Ephetae. Hence, there is a sense in which
the statement of Pollux is true, that in Solon’s time ‘the
Ephetae sat in the five murder courts.’<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>We have now sufficiently indicated the methods and laws
of Greek blood-vengeance in the post-Homeric epoch and in
historical times. We may, therefore, proceed to examine
and, if possible, to explain the problems of blood-vengeance
which are presented by Attic tragedy. In our account of
Homeric homicide we found it necessary to distinguish between
a military dominant Achaean caste on the one hand, and
a subject Pelasgian tribal people on the other. In our exposition
of post-Homeric and historical developments we
found it indispensable to distinguish the post-Achaean and
Hesiodic periods from the ‘pollution’ era and to regard the
final evolution of historical Greek murder law as a resultant
compromise between divergent forces. When we turn to
the legends which are given by the Attic tragedians, we must
be prepared to consider the operation of several distinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
alternative factors in the creation of these legends. Some
legends are presented to us in a form which seems quite
consistent with the period to which they refer, either
because they came down comparatively unadulterated through
the ages or because the dramatist consciously and correctly
archaised. Other legends, however, become so adulterated
in course of time that they are difficult to analyse and their
evidential value is very small. Again, different myths about
the same event assumed, in different places and at various
times, forms which were legally, at least, incompatible. It
was open to the dramatists to make a selection from amongst
the most suitable varieties of the legend; but they naturally
aimed at consistency in characterisation, rather than at
harmony in their legal conceptions. As a result of the variety
of inconsistent legends it was obviously impossible for those
dramatists to fulfil the maxim of Horace<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>:</p>

<p>The ruthless hand of callous Fortune has robbed the world
and civilisation of all save seven of the dramatic works of
Aeschylus, the first and perhaps the greatest of European
tragedians. Of these seven extant plays, there are only
three which directly and formally present any problems of
blood-vengeance. These three plays are concerned with a
single theme, the murder of Agamemnon, King of Argos, by
his wife Clytaemnestra and by her paramour Aegisthus, and
the subsequent vengeance of Orestes. In the remaining
plays (if one excludes the <i>Persians</i>) one finds occasional and
incidental references to bloodshed, which require and will
receive from us only a brief discussion. It is the Oresteian
‘trilogy’ which is our first and chief concern.</p>

<p>Horace<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> mentions the following maxim as one of the
canons of ancient dramatic art:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(‘Either follow tradition or create new themes which are
congruous and consistent’). Now these alternatives are not
necessarily mutually exclusive unless the tradition is rigidly
stereotyped. A considerable scope for inventive genius and
dramatic skill was provided by such legends as those which
centred around Orestes. We are convinced that there existed
quite a number of variants in the story of Orestes.</p>

<p>First of all, there was the original Homeric story, to which
we have already referred.<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In this account, Orestes slew his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
mother and Aegisthus in strict accordance with the Achaean
system of vendetta. His act was not murder but just
revenge. There is no suggestion of an ancestral curse, of
an indefinite series of murders continuing from generation
to generation. Blood has been shed; blood is avenged by
blood. It was the Achaean principle, whether for strangers
or for kinsmen. There is no trace of divine interference or
of social justice. Apollo has no place or part in the story:
there is no trial or official execution. We cannot discover
even the element of psychological conflict. The Achaeans were
soldiers, trained in the stern school of war. Neither emotion
nor family religion stood between passion and its satisfaction.</p>

<p>But the legend or legends which are found in Aeschylus
present very obvious and important points of difference.
Are we to suppose that Aeschylus was not aware of any other
tradition save that which Homer gives, that all the non-Homeric
elements in the Aeschylean account are Aeschylus’
own invention, and that in this invention he was guided by
the laws and the atmosphere of his own time? This is not
our view of the matter. The Homeric legend, in our opinion,
had a long and varied career before Aeschylus was born. It
came down through many centuries, reflecting, as it came,
many different atmospheres, and assimilating many different
points of view, as it took shape in various localities.</p>

<p>Thus there was, we maintain, an Arcadian legend which
told how Orestes came as an exile—a murder-exile—to Azania
and to the town called Oresteum,<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and how he died there as
the result of snake-bite.<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is impossible to reconcile this
version of the story with another which represented him as
having married Hermione<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and as having reigned as King
of Sparta; and with another story of his reign as King of
Argos.<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Again, we shall see that there probably was an Argive
legend, which mentioned a trial of Orestes at Argos at which
he was condemned to death. From a legal point of view,
this is the most important variant of the Homeric saga.
Euripides gives it due prominence in the <i>Orestes</i>, but Aeschylus
and Sophocles ignore it altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>Again, in what we conceive to have been the Attic forms
of the legend, there must have been at least two variations.
In our analysis of the Attic law concerning justifiable homicide,<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
we pointed out that at one point the conception of homicide
as justifiable may be very closely related to the conception
of homicide as extenuated. The short duration of the exile
penalty in cases of manslaughter or of slaying in a ‘passion’
when the act is ‘forgiven’ indicates a very slight legal difference
between these two standpoints. Yet they cannot of course
be regarded as identical, and they cannot even be fused or
blended without a considerable indifference to consistency.
In the transition from the Homeric age to historical times
it was inevitable that Apollo, the champion and founder
of the ‘pollution’ doctrine and of homicide-purgation rites
in Greek lands, should have been drawn into the story. He
is ignored, as we shall see later, in the Argive legend of
Orestes. But he is found in all the other variants. Yet his
rôle is not simple and definite. He purges Orestes certainly:
but what was the nature of the guilt which he has purged?
Was the act of Orestes justifiable or extenuated? In Homer
the act was justifiable from the Achaean standpoint; but the
legend-makers of the ‘pollution’ era could not accept that
solution. For them, the immunity of Orestes could only be
explained by the direct intervention of Apollo in advance.
But this intervention was at one stage conceived as a complete
justification, at another as a mere extenuation of the vengeance
of Orestes. We shall find traces of both these conceptions
in Aeschylus. In Sophocles the conception of Orestes’ act as
justifiable matricide is predominant: in Euripides it does
not appear at all. The interpretation of Orestes’ act as extenuated
matricide does indeed appear in Euripides, but it is
subordinated to another viewpoint which is quite incompatible
with this—namely, the viewpoint of the Argive legend which
ignores Apollo and regards Orestes as a common matricide
who is worthy only of death.</p>

<p>One or two other minor variations may be traced in the
Oresteian legends. Thus we read of a sentence which is very
suggestive of perpetual exile in the <i>Electra</i> of Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
while in other plays there is a reference to the penalty of exile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
for the duration of a single year, a penalty which is elsewhere
extended by a decree of Apollo so as to permit Orestes to
embark upon a second expedition—this time to the Tauric
Chersonese!<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Again, the story which was invented to explain
the Athenian Pitcher-Feast, and which is mentioned in the
<i>Iphigenia Taurica</i> of Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is quite inconsistent with
the Aeschylean legends, for in the former case Orestes was
represented as ‘polluted’ when he came to Attica, while in
the latter he is said to have been already ‘purged.’</p>

<p>The legal aspect of the Oresteia is further complicated
by what we may term archaic assumptions. We hope to
show presently that the Attic legends of Orestes would have
been legally unintelligible if the Athenian legend-makers had
not assumed that Orestes came to Athens as an exile <i>after</i> he
had slain his mother, and not, as Homer said, <i>before</i>. Again,
if they had not assumed that the Areopagus court, which in
historical times did not normally judge cases of homicide
between strangers, did judge such cases in early times, and
that its verdict of acquittal, which was ordinarily a proof of
the innocence of the accused, could at one time have been
applied to a person who admitted the fact but pleaded justification,
the legal analysis of this legend would have been impossible.
We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that before Solon the Areopagus
court adjudicated in all kinds of homicide cases. The attribution
of such functions to the Areopagus by Attic legend is
therefore an archaism, even though it is an ‘historical’
archaism. We cannot be certain whether the archaism was
transmitted from the sixth century onwards or whether it was
‘invented’ by later minds by a process which is described
as ‘conscious archaising.’ Again, according to the legend
which conceived Orestes’ act as extenuated matricide, he had
already served a period of exile before he reached Athens.
In this account, therefore, the Areopagus merely decreed
him immune from further penalties. But such a decree was
never associated with the historical Areopagus! Thus it is
clear that the Oresteian legends sometimes contain ‘unhistorical’
archaisms. We must now consider in detail the
Aeschylean presentation of the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Agamemnon.’</span></h4>

<p>The outstanding event of the <i>Agamemnon</i> drama, the
pivot upon which the plot revolves, and the catastrophe which
gives it meaning, is the brutal murder by Clytaemnestra of
her husband, Agamemnon, King of Argos, after his triumphant
return from Troy. In this play Aeschylus follows in the
main the Homeric story, but there are one or two non-Homeric
features which must be indicated.</p>

<p>In the gloomy chants of the Chorus, in their veiled fears
of coming danger, one finds something more than the echoes
of a political conspiracy, one finds the unmistakable influence
of the creed of the ancestral curse. Are we to suppose that
Aeschylus invented this non-Homeric doctrine which, in his
own day, was a ‘creed outworn’? Such a supposition is
improbable, for we know from Stesichorus<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that this doctrine
had already in the sixth century been incorporated in the
legend. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> attributed the <i>floruit</i> of this
doctrine to the post-Homeric age of chaos. Such beliefs
survive in dogma and in ritual long after men have ceased
to adhere to them. In Aeschylus the ancestral curse began
with the famous ‘feast of Thyestes,’ but Euripides attributes
its origin to the murder of Myrtilus.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The Erinnyes of the
children who were brutally slain by their kinsman Atreus
continued to pursue the children of the slayer. Hence, in
this play Cassandra, the prophetess, cries out on her arrival
at Argos<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>:</p>

<p class="noindent">In these lines we can hear the rumblings of the coming
storm. When the storm has passed, when the curse has
found its mark, Clytaemnestra echoes the same sentiment,
thus representing herself as the divine instrument of an
avenging Justice. She says to the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">And hath sternly repaid a grown victim for little ones slain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A second important point of difference between the Homeric
story and that of the <i>Agamemnon</i> is the reference in the
latter story to the ‘sacrifice of Iphigeneia,’ the daughter of
Agamemnon, at the hands of her father, at Aulis, and the
interpretation of this act, by Clytaemnestra, as a justification
for the death which she inflicted on Agamemnon. It would
take us too far afield if we attempted to explain, at this stage,
the origin of the story of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. England
gives an excellent account of this difficult problem in his
edition of the <i>Iphigenia Taurica</i> of Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and we
shall recur to this topic when we come to deal with that play.
The following points, however, may here be briefly indicated:</p>

<p>(1) The ‘sacrifice’ of the daughter of Agamemnon to Artemis
at Aulis would certainly have been referred to by Homer
if it had been an historical fact, or even if the poet had heard
a rumour of such a strange event.</p>

<p>(2) This sacrifice, which is used as a ‘plea’ by Clytaemnestra,
and which is a well-established element in the Oresteian
legends of Attic tragedy, could hardly have been the invention
of Aeschylus, for it tends to diminish the guilt of the villains
of the drama, Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus, and it is far
too complex a story to be attributed to the invention of a
single mind. The confusion of the Homeric word Iphianassa
with Iphigeneia, which was merely a cultus-epithet of the
goddess Artemis, the invention of a mock human sacrifice
at Aulis which was suggested by a sham rite of human sacrifice
at a temple of Artemis in the Attic coast town of Halae, and
the translation of Iphigeneia to a Tauric temple of Artemis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
where Orestes was said to have interviewed his sister—all these
facts suggest, we think, the ‘ecclesiastical’ origin of the story.</p>

<p>(3) The doctrine of the ancestral curse would not have
mediated the identification of Iphigeneia with Iphianassa.
According to this doctrine the death of Agamemnon was a
natural result of the curse of Thyestes. But the sacrificial death
of Iphigeneia cannot naturally be connected with such a curse.</p>

<p>(4) The Attic legend which regarded Orestes as justified
by Apollo cannot be supposed to have contributed to the
genesis of the Iphigeneia story. It is not probable that such
a legend, which conceived Clytaemnestra as a murderess
and an adulteress, would have also presented her as the heroic
avenger of an act of sacrificial bloodshed which was performed
in obedience to a divine command.</p>

<p>(5) It is probable therefore that, although this legend of
the ‘sacrifice’ may have originated independently of the
Oresteia, it was in conjunction with a second Attic legend
which decreed for Orestes a temporary period of exile, and
which depicted a less implacable but persistent pursuit by
the as yet unappeased Erinnyes, that the story of the sacrifice
of Iphigeneia developed and took final shape. For when
once a legend has admitted in the hero a degree of guilt, it
is so much easier to admit also a degree of excellence in the
villain. Hence it is that in Aeschylus, who follows mainly
the first of these legends, this ‘plea’ of Clytaemnestra is not
presented in a natural or forcible manner.</p>

<p>It is only at the end of the play, when the spectators are
so fully convinced of the amorous infidelity, the designing
malice, the flagrant hypocrisy and the murderous brutality
of this queen of Argos, that they cannot attach much value
to the boastful words which proclaim her love of her children,
that she says to the railing critics in the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Prate not of dishonour! ‘Deserving’ were rather the word.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had <i>he</i> not prepared for his house an encumbrance of woe?</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Let him not loudly plead there below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in paying the price of her death whom a nation deplored,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The branch I had reared from his loins, he is slain with iniquitous sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Men shall reap what they sow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>In regard to the penalty which Clytaemnestra expects
to suffer, the language of Aeschylus is deliberately vague.
The Chorus say<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou cut him off? Thou shalt be cut off from the State.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our citizens shall hate thee with firm hate.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Clytaemnestra interprets these words as a threat of exile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That is your sentence: I must fly the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With public execration on my head.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that an option of exile would have been
permitted in such cases in historical Attic law, for husband
and wife were not usually akin in blood. But the Achaeans
did not recognise the exile penalty in any circumstances.
We have said<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that the penalty of death and private vendetta
were the characteristics of Achaean vengeance. They also
characterised at various periods the blood-feuds of noble or
royal families whose conduct was uncontrolled by law. Thus,
in fourth-century Macedonia blood-vengeance was still of an
Achaean or quasi-Achaean type. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> tells how
Antipater, the brother of Alexander, ordered the Macedonians
to stone to death the queen-regent Olympias, and himself
poisoned the sons of Alexander: how in turn Alexander called
in Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, and succeeded by his help
in deposing his brother Antipater and in punishing him for
his matricide. Thus Aeschylus, without knowing anything
of the different modes of vengeance of the Achaeans and the
Pelasgians, was enabled, by the predominance of Achaean
vengeance in Homer, and the occurrence of quasi-Achaean
vengeance in outlying regions, to visualise<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> correctly the
Achaean vengeance of Orestes, and the Achaean punishment
of Clytaemnestra. Hence he makes the Chorus say<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O that Orestes, if he lives to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might yet return auspiciously to Argos</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kill both tyrants in his pride of power!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Hence the exile to which Clytaemnestra<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> refers is an Achaean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
‘flight from death.’ But the penalty of death was the ultimate
aim of Achaean vengeance; and therefore the Chorus say<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Robber is robbed: slayer slain: revenge is sure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Firm stands, while Zeus remains upon his throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One law: who doeth shall likewise suffer.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Choephoroe’</span></h4>

<p>In the <i>Choephoroe</i> Orestes slays his mother and her
paramour. Two important deviations from the Homeric
saga are manifest throughout the play: (1) the conception
of homicide as a ‘pollution,’ and (2) the command which is
given by the Delphian Apollo to Orestes, to slay his mother
in vengeance for his father’s murder. Thus Orestes says<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We shall not fail: Apollo’s mighty word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will be performed, that bade me stem this peril.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High rose that sovran voice, and clearly spake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of stormy curses that should freeze my blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should I not wreak my father’s wrongful death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is no doubt about the meaning of these words. Apollo,
the oracle-god of the Delphian Amphictyony, which, as we
think,<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> contributed so much to the historical homicide code
of Greece, has issued a definite command. It must be obeyed.
If it is executed, its execution must be just. No penalties
can attach to such avenging, but punishment unthinkable
follows failure to avenge. Orestes tells us that he would
at least have lost his life if he did not slay his mother. But a
real Homeric Achaean would not have suffered for failure to
avenge. Was this Aeschylean conception, then, derived
from contemporary Attic law? Would an Athenian citizen
of historical times have suffered in such circumstances?
We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that pecuniary ‘private settlements’ were
actual events, though not, as we think, legal events in historical
Athens. In such cases a relative of the slain would have
benefited by failure to prosecute.<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But we have also shown
that in Athens a relative of a slain person who did not
prosecute could be proceeded against on a charge of impiety:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and it is probable that, if convicted, he would have been
degraded from citizenship and sentenced to perpetual exile.
Are we then to suppose that Aeschylus deliberately imported
into the Homeric story conceptions which he borrowed from
contemporary Attic law, and that he also imported Apollo
as a <i>deus ex machina</i> whose rôle it was to propound Athenian
law to an Achaean king? This hypothesis is very unsatisfactory.
We prefer to believe that the non-Homeric elements
in this play had gradually found their way into the legend
as it was transmitted down the ages. It is, of course, unfortunate
that the legend-makers did not remember that
Orestes lived at a time when murder was not regarded as a
‘pollution’: but in a legend which evolved through a long
period of time it was inevitable that sentiments and customs
of a later age should have been attributed, anachronistically,
to the people of earlier periods.</p>

<p>We have already referred<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to the anger which it was
believed that a slain person felt towards his relatives who
did not avenge him, and which contributed to the ‘pollution’
of delinquent relatives. It is only from this standpoint that
we can understand Orestes’ reference to the evils that would
follow his failure to avenge<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The darkling arrow of the dead that flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From kindred souls abominably slain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And madness and vain terror of the mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should harass and unman me till the State</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should drive me forth, with brands upon my body.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So vexed, so banished, I should have no share</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wine or dear libation, but unseen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My father’s wrath should drive me from all altars.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None should receive me: none should dwell with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my long friendless life, bereft of honours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should shrivel down to darkness and decay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reference to the State in this quotation is noteworthy.
In such a reference we find ourselves very far removed from the
Homeric saga and the days of private vengeance! The brand
or stigma which is mentioned is that civic degradation which is
known as ἄτιμία. We cannot suppose that these actual words
were recorded in the legend which Aeschylus follows. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
statement is much too long for a real oracle! Did Aeschylus
then derive this sentiment from contemporary Attic life? We
have seen that the pollution-doctrine was closely associated,
in Greece, with the interference of the State in matters of
homicide. It follows that the importation of this doctrine
into the Oresteian legend would have naturally introduced,
also, the conception of Orestes as a State criminal, worthy of
State punishment. When once the legend received, so to
speak, this colouring, the general atmosphere of the story
would have suggested such words as are attributed in this
quotation to Orestes. We believe that these words of Orestes
are the creation of Aeschylus’ own mind, but we do not attribute
to Aeschylus the creation of the legendary atmosphere
which makes such words intelligible.</p>

<p>There is a subtle suggestion of the clash of clan-feuds which
characterised the transition period of the Dark Ages in the
Aeschylean description of the conflict of viewpoints between the
Erinnyes of Agamemnon and the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra—a
conflict which it is improbable that Aeschylus invented. The
avenging goddesses are conceived as real beings: they are not
mere delusions or ‘extrajections’ of a distracted mind. We
have already referred<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> to Orestes’ fear of the ‘darkling arrow’
which may be hurled at him by the Erinnyes of his father. On
the other side, however, stand the Erinnyes of his mother, who
are equally formidable. Orestes says<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">Ah! ah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What grisly troup come yonder in grey robes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With Gorgon faces and thick serpent hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Twisted in writhing coils? I must be gone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is no fancy, but a present woe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I see my mother’s Furies clearly there!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This conflict Apollo, of himself unaided, is unable to avert.
But we shall now see how Apollo and Athene, in conjunction,
persuade the Furies of Clytaemnestra to accept ‘appeasement.’
It was thus, as we conceive it, that the religion of pollution and
political synoekism ultimately overcame the resistance of the
clans to new laws and new gods. It was thus that, after years
of chaos and transition, ghosts came at length to obey State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
gods and State laws as in tribal life they obeyed the ‘dooms’
of the tribe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Eumenides’</span></h4>

<p>The main theme of the <i>Eumenides</i> is the trial, at the
Athenian Areopagus, of the Argive Orestes who had slain at
Argos his mother and her paramour, and who upon acquittal
returns to Argos to occupy the throne of his murdered father.
We admit that the exaltation of the Areopagus is one of the
motives of the dramatist. There is much to be said for the
view of Blass<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that the conflict between Apollo and the Furies
made this ‘divine drama’ worthy of Athenian interest. But
we maintain that Aeschylus would not have selected such a
theme for presentation to an Athenian audience, if it had not
also contained a difficult legal problem which was calculated to
thrill the emotions of those litigious men of Athens who were
at once judges, litigants and legislators. The play was produced
at the time of the curtailment of the powers of the
Areopagus by Pericles and by Ephialtes. Aeschylus suggests<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
that it was this Council which held the first trial for bloodshed
in a barbarian world. In this view there is no protest against
the reform of Ephialtes, for such a reform seemed to recognise
that homicide-trial was the sole and proper function of the
Areopagus.</p>

<p>Whether the play was produced before or after this reform
it is impossible to say. Bury holds<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that the play is not a
protest after the event, that, on the contrary, Aeschylus
approved of the reform. Other scholars maintain, however,
that Aeschylus was opposed to democratic interference with
the established privileges of an ancient Council, and that he left
Athens on this account and died in Sicily of a broken heart.<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Our reading of the play inclines us to support the view of
Jevons which will be manifest from the following extract<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>:
‘The <i>Eumenides</i>,’ he says, ‘was produced in 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> ... at
a time of great political excitement in Athens. The oligarchical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
party had just been defeated on both their foreign and their
home policy. Their foreign policy was alliance with Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The home policy consisted in opposing such changes in the
constitution as would give more power to the people, and at
this time also consisted particularly in supporting the powers
and privileges of the Areopagus against the attacks of the
democratic party.... The democrats under Ephialtes
succeeded in depriving the Areopagus of its political powers,
leaving to it only the right of trying cases of homicide....<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The <i>Eumenides</i> is sometimes said to be a panegyric on the
Areopagus and sometimes even to have been a call to all good
men to join in preserving to it the political powers which it had
long enjoyed. But it is probable that the <i>Eumenides</i> was
produced after the reforms of Ephialtes: and as Aeschylus
represents the Aeropagus to have been founded to try cases of
homicide, the very class of cases which Ephialtes left to it,
it is more reasonable to regard the play as having been intended
to reconcile those who strove for the preservation of the political
powers of the Areopagus to the new state of things which
Aeschylus shows to be in harmony with the original nature
of the court. This view receives some support from the fact
that the alliance with Argos to which the oligarchic party
was opposed is also shown by Aeschylus (727 <i>et seq.</i>) to be in
harmony with tradition, myth, and religion.’<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Verrall takes up a similar attitude to this problem<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>: ‘It is
clear,’ he says, ‘from the tone of the final scene and it is
generally recognised that Aeschylus did not intend to appear
at least as a partisan, that he supposed himself to be a peacemaker
and to have advanced only what would be generally
approved. He justifies trial by jury: he extols the Areopagus
as a court of crime: he leaves room, but in vague terms, for a
larger execution of its vigilant protection.... He is for the
middle way, “neither tyranny nor anarchy.”... But the attitude
of the poet is not that of a practical politician. Religion,
always first with him, in the <i>Eumenides</i> covers the whole
field.’</p>

<p>We do not agree with Verrall’s view that Aeschylus justifies
‘trial by jury,’ if Verrall means by this phrase trial by popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
juries such as the Heliasts of the post-Solonian age. The
Areopagus was never invaded by the Heliasts. Its procedure
was fundamentally different from that of Heliastic courts. Its
personnel was composed of archons and ex-archons. It is to
such judges that Athene refers when she says that she will
select, for the trial, the best of her citizens.<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> There was for
the Areopagus no election by lot, such as characterised the
popular juries,<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> nor is there in the phrase ἀστῶν τῶν ἐμῶν τὰ
βέλτατα any reference to the Ephetae, the aristocracy of birth.
Aeschylus either never knew, or he has forgotten, or he has
perhaps deliberately ignored the aristocratic character of
the pre-Solonian Ephetae-Areopagus.<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is the plutocratic
Solonian Areopagus of the sixth century and of his own day
that he puts before us. When Verrall says that ‘Aeschylus
leaves room ... for a larger execution of its vigilant protection,’
he implies that Aeschylus opposed the reform of Ephialtes.
As this view commits Aeschylus to the exaltation of plutocracy,
we prefer, with the scholiast, to give a narrower interpretation
to the phrase εὑδόντων ὕπερ ἐγρηγορὸς φρούρημα<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and we
translate it: ‘the vigilant custodian of vengeance for the slain,’
whereas Verrall takes the ‘sleepers’ to mean ‘the citizens
when they are asleep at night.’</p>

<p>We think, moreover, that Verrall overestimates the religious
as distinct from the legal aspect of the play. Apollo and the
Furies seem to us to present a rather sordid picture at the
trial. If Apollo had maintained his traditional rôle of
Olympian autocracy, he would have been more impressive.
As it is, he condescends to discuss the justice of Orestes’
act with rival deities of a quasi-diabolical type: and his
arguments are rhetorical rather than logical. He advances
the absurd opinion that the real parent of a child is the
father not the mother.<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> This view and the similar opinion
of Athene<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> may of course be explained as a characteristic
sentiment of the Eupatridae, an Athenian noble caste, who
were excluded from the worship<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of the Semnai Theai
at Athens, a sentiment which is here directed against the
Erinnyes, by way of anticipation, in view of their prospective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
metamorphosis into Semnai Theai.<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But it is more probable
that the argument represents an undignified squabble between
Olympian gods and Chthonian goddesses, between the deities
of the ‘pollution’ religion and of new-born Greek States, on
the one hand, and the old clan-ghosts who are here conceived
as Titans, on the other.<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The Furies are not even consistent
with themselves. At one time<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> they pose as the avengers of
all kinds of homicide: at another<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> they are only concerned
with kin-slaying. The Olympian exaltation of ‘the father’
is met, swiftly and flippantly, in the manner of repartee, by an
objectionable quotation from Olympian theology! ‘Did not
Zeus,’ the Furies ask,<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> ‘bind in chains his aged father Kronos?’
The answer of Apollo is even weaker than the question: ‘to
fetter,’ he says, ‘is not to slay....<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Remedies for the one
are easy, remedies for the other there are none!’ If then the
religious aspect of the trial of Orestes had been predominant or
paramount in the mind of Aeschylus, we do not think that he
would have presented the gods in such a frivolous and futile
manner to an audience of Athenian citizens. He would, much
more probably, have followed a different form of the legend,
which is found in Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and is mentioned by
Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and which represented the Twelve Olympian
Gods as the judges of Orestes’ guilt. Hence we believe that
the dramatic aspect of the story was the more important one
for Aeschylus. The essence of tragedy is conflict, and there is
conflict in the <i>Eumenides</i>, between rival emotions, between rival
ethical theories, between rival gods and goddesses, first, last,
and all the time! But next in importance to the dramatic
motive we place the legal motive of the play. We do not agree
with Verrall in maintaining<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that ‘what is certain is that in
the law of the matter, the law proper, he (Aeschylus) took little
interest. The ultimate issue of his play is not legal but religious....
It matters nothing that the prosecutors, in different parts
of the play, assume, respecting the limits of punishable homicide,
views which are not compatible: or again that the question of
the validity of the oracular command, though it is a main point
in the defence, and though the jury must be supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
disagree about it, is not argued, unless contradiction is argument,
at all.... On law, therefore, and the history of law, the
<i>Eumenides</i> is but a dubious authority: and the reader or
expositor of Aeschylus as such is not bound or perhaps entitled
to consider the play from this point of view.’ This kind of
reasoning seems to us very suggestive of a well-defined mental
attitude, namely, that of a writer who knows little or nothing
about law and who, in addition, does not want to know anything
about it. We do not assert that the legal problems of the
<i>Eumenides</i> are simple, but they cannot for that reason be
ignored. The more difficult a problem is, the greater is the
prestige of a court which can decide the issue. Athene confesses
the difficulty of the problem in this play and she requests
the citizens of Athens to solve it.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> What an exaltation of
religion! What a contempt for law!</p>

<p>The legal complexities of the trial of Orestes arise, we have
said, from the circumstances which attended the evolution
of the legends. The introduction of the story of Apollo’s command
to Orestes was intended by the legend-makers of the
‘pollution’ era to explain and to reinforce the Homeric conception
of Orestes’ act as justifiable matricide. That Apollo’s
command justified his act is the legal plea of Orestes, in this
play; at least, it is the predominant plea.</p>

<p>Thus he says to Apollo<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now give thy witness and expound the truth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo, was I just in slaying her?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To have done it I deny not. ’Tis the fact.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But whether to thy thought this matricide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be justified or no, declare thy mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For information of those present here.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We may naturally ask: ‘Why is Apollo appealed to for judgment,
when he has been cited as a witness?’ We have argued
that, in Attic law, if we may trust Plato,<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> matricide could
never have been legally justified. On the other hand the
Apolline doctrine of pollution declared that the defaulting
avenger was polluted. The pollution doctrine permitted
and did not condemn ‘private execution.’ It was synoekised
State power which made such execution criminal.<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
conflict which is presented by these different points of view
was too grave a matter for the decision of a human court.
The command of Apollo was regarded by the legend-makers
as the only solution of that conflict. The only question
which a human court could be reasonably expected to decide
was the question whether Apollo did actually command the
act of Orestes. If the actuality of such a command was
established, the acquittal of Orestes was inevitable. The
only alternative possibility was a verdict of ‘responsibility
for murder’<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> against Apollo! But such a verdict, in the
religious atmosphere of the ancient City, would have been
unthinkable.</p>

<p>So far therefore the legal issue in the <i>Eumenides</i> is comparatively
intelligible. But we must call attention to the peculiar
fact that in the play Orestes is represented as having been tried
not at Argos but at Athens. If Orestes had slain his mother
at Athens, his act would have been, in Athenian law, a case of
homicide between foreigners, and such an act, though normally
in Aeschylean Athens tried by the Palladium court, could quite
conceivably, in pre-Solonian times, have been tried by the
Areopagus. But Orestes did not slay his mother at Athens,
and therefore the case would not have come before any
Athenian court, unless Orestes intended to reside at Athens,
and his right to reside at Athens was challenged by the relatives
of the slain. Now, in Greek extradition law these relatives<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
had no right to object to the residence of the slayer ‘abroad’
unless he was guilty of wilful kin-slaying, as, for instance, of
wilful matricide: for the penalty for kin-slaying in historical
times was death, without the option of exile. It is precisely on
such a charge of wilful matricide that the Erinnyes, in this play,
prosecute Orestes. To that extent their prosecution was
lawful. But the fact that the prosecution took place at Athens
implies that Orestes intended to live in Athens as an exile,
at least for a time. We have pointed out that, according to
Greek extradition law, the relatives of the slain could have compelled
the fellow-citizens of the slayer to try him or to extradite
him if he fled to them for refuge. But in cases of kin-slaying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
it is probable that any State to which the slayer fled could have
been compelled to put him on trial before they received him as
an exile, or otherwise to expel or extradite him. Yet the
avenging relatives were not compelled to accept a verdict of
acquittal in any court as a complete restoration of the slayer
to social and religious communion, just as in certain cases of
kin-slaying the relatives were not compelled to admit the slayer
to domestic communion, even when his own State court had
permitted his return from exile. Hence, in the Oresteia, a
verdict of acquittal brought in by the Athenian Areopagus in
regard to a foreign Argive kin-slayer was primarily intended to
legalise the residence at Athens of Orestes, but it could not have
legalised his return to Argos unless the relatives of the slain
accepted the verdict of the Athenian court as a final verdict
of innocence, and ceased, of their own accord, from further
prosecution. Now, the legends of Orestes seem to differ in
their account of the ‘appeasement’ of the Erinnyes of
Clytaemnestra. In some legends, as in that upon which is
based the <i>Iphigenia Taurica</i> of Euripides, the Furies do not
accept the verdict of the Areopagus, and continue to pursue
him over land and sea. The fact that they can drive him out
of Athens is due to their divine power. In law, ordinary
human relatives could not have done so. But it is clear that,
in the absence of unanimity in regard to the attitude of the
Erinnyes to the Areopagus, the Attic legend-makers who emphasised
the connexion of Orestes with the Areopagus must
have assumed that Orestes intended to reside, at least for a
time, as a homicide-exile at Athens. Now there is no evidence
in Homer of such an intention on the part of Orestes. In
Homer, Orestes went to Athens <i>before</i>, not <i>after</i>, he slew
his mother. Hence the whole basis of the Attic legends
of Orestes is a pure assumption, without any historical
foundation.</p>

<p>The main difficulty which the ancients found in the post-Homeric
legends of Orestes was the interpretation of the
command which Apollo gave to Orestes. Some legends, of
course, such as that which we have called the ‘Argive legend,’<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
did not include any reference whatever to such a command.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
But in the Attic legends, which represent this command as an
essential element in the story, there is no precise and definite
answer to the question: ‘Did this command justify the
vengeance of Orestes or was it a mere “extenuation” of his
guilt?’ We have said that the conception of this command
as a complete justification predominates in the <i>Eumenides</i>,
though the Erinnyes naturally object to this interpretation.
But the command may also be regarded as an abnormal psychic
factor which would make it possible to interpret the act of
Orestes as ‘kin-slaying in a passion,’ or extenuated kin-slaying,
which is akin to involuntary homicide. It is only thus that we
can explain the reference in certain forms of the legend to a
penalty of one year’s exile: and to other details of punishment
which are never associated with voluntary homicide. The
Furies, in the <i>Eumenides</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> find it difficult to conceive that
Orestes will ever return to his domestic religion. Now Plato<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
asserts that a son who slew his parent in a passion could not,
unless the dying parent ‘forgave,’ return again to his domestic
hearth, even though he could return, after a period of exile, to
his native State. We cannot suppose that the Furies, in the
<i>Eumenides</i>, represent an attitude of ‘forgiveness’ on the part
of Clytaemnestra, and hence we could not expect them to
accept the possibility of Orestes’ return to his native home in
Argos. But the mere mention of such a detail suggests a plea
of quasi-involuntary matricide. A verdict of acquittal on a
plea of justifiable slaying is precisely the verdict which the
Erinnyes in Aeschylus, before their ‘conversion,’ cannot
recognise. But they might have accepted as an alternative
to their charge of wilful matricide a charge of extenuated
matricide. Such a charge, such a conception of Orestes’ guilt,
is very prominent in a form of the legend which Euripides
gives.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But even in Aeschylus this conception is not altogether
absent, though it is very much suppressed, perhaps
because it was inconsistent with the dominant viewpoint of the
Aeschylean drama. Thus, Orestes suggests that before he
came to Athens to stand his trial he had already atoned for
any element of guilt which was involved in his obedience
to Apollo. He says to Athene, before the trial<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Nothing can remove the inconsistency in this quotation. We
seek merely to explain it by attributing it to a confusion of two
different legends, which viewed the act of Orestes from two
different legal standpoints. In this passage Aeschylus happens
to emphasise a standpoint which he usually ignores, namely the
conception of Orestes as a matricide of partial guilt, or as an
extenuated matricide, the conception which underlies the stories
of the wandering of Orestes and of his sojourn as a homicide-exile
in various lands. If Aeschylus does not consistently
exclude this conception from his drama, this must be attributed
not only to a certain legal affinity which exists between the
conception<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of Orestes as justified, and the conception of him
as partially guilty, but also to a confusion of these conceptions
in pre-existing legends.</p>

<p>This analysis which we have given indicates, at least, the
value of legal considerations for the complete intelligibility of
this play. For the history of law, also, we may infer from
Aeschylus, or rather from pre-Aeschylean legend, that the early
Areopagus, and therefore the early Ephetae courts, adjudicated
in various kinds of homicide cases. The division of labour
which took place, we believe,<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in pre-Solonian times, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
left to the Areopagus exclusive jurisdiction in cases of wilful
murder, of malicious wounding, and of poisoning with intent
to kill, had obviously not yet appeared at the time when this
Attic legend took shape. There is thus no basis for Ridgeway’s
hypothesis<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that the place of Orestes’ trial was not the
Areopagus but the Palladium. The image of Athene which
Orestes embraces in the <i>Eumenides</i> was not, as Ridgeway
thinks, the famous wooden image of the goddess at the Palladium,
but was rather, as Müller points out,<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the image of
Athene on the Acropolis.</p>

<p>The relation between the legal and the dramatic aspects of
the story of Orestes may be indicated by the following useful,
if fanciful, hypothesis: Let us suppose, for the moment, that
there existed in the time of Aeschylus no other legends of Orestes
except that which is found in the Homeric poems. If Aeschylus
wished to incorporate this legend, in the form of a tragic drama,
following we may assume in his dramatic art the Horatian
maxim<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he could have followed one or other of two possible courses:
On the one hand he could have simply dramatised the Homeric
story in its original setting, thus giving us what would be
called an ‘historical drama,’ or, on the other hand, he could
have invented a ‘drama’ in which the facts, the names and
the characters alone were Homeric, but the ideas, the viewpoints,
the legal and religious atmosphere were derived from
contemporary life. If Aeschylus had chosen the former course
he could not have produced a trilogy such as we now possess:
the <i>Eumenides</i> at least would have been impossible: he could,
however, have written the <i>Agamemnon</i>, and a <i>Choephoroe</i> somewhat
similar to, though also somewhat different from, our present
play, as both these dramas are Homeric in their main outlook.
Again, if we suppose that Aeschylus chose the second course, the
<i>Agamemnon</i> would still have been possible: but the <i>Choephoroe</i>
would have been unrecognisable—in fact, there could not have
been a <i>Choephoroe</i> at all: Orestes could not have been regarded
as the sole or proper agent of execution: if he slew his mother
without trial, or without having given her the option of exile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
he would have been a State criminal, liable to prosecution as
a matricide or a violator of civic law. The <i>Eumenides</i> would
also, in this hypothesis, have been very different. There could
not have been any doubt regarding Orestes’ guilt or the verdict
of the court: there could not have been any conflict between
Apollo and the Erinnyes. There could, in short, have been no
<i>Eumenides</i> drama worthy of the name. We may therefore,
as a result of this reasoning, and from the actual nature of the
extant Oresteian trilogy, infer that there must have existed
a post-Homeric pre-Aeschylean legend, or legends, of Orestes
which predetermined the Aeschylean presentation of the story.
These legends, by combining very different reflections in the
course of legal and religious developments, created the moral
and the legal problems of the Oresteia. It was probably these
problems which constituted, for the litigiously minded Athenian
people, the main dramatic interest of the <i>Eumenides</i>, if not
also of the <i>Choephoroe</i>. But that interest was purchased at
the cost of obscurity and confusion. It is, for instance, quite
inconsistent for Aeschylus to have represented the trial of
Orestes as the first Greek trial<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of homicide and at the same
time to have conceived Orestes as guilty of bloodshed: for it was
at the precise moment at which State trial and State execution
came into being that Orestes became a criminal! Before that
moment he was simply the normal avenger of blood. This
inconsistency is, we think, a proof that the Aeschylean story
was not his own invention: for if Aeschylus had invented it, it
would not have contained so many inconsistencies. On the
other hand, inconsistency would naturally have characterised
a legend which evolved through ages of legal and religious
transitions. When once it had become stereotyped in the
story, Aeschylus could not, even if he would, have thought
it away.</p>

<p>Verrall therefore is right in saying<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> ‘That a legend gave
the main fact, the prosecution of Orestes by the Erinnyes before
a tribunal at Athens and his acquittal there, might safely be
inferred from the play and is beyond doubt.’ And Müller
says<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>: ‘The transmutation of the Erinnyes into Eumenides
formed in Greece an essential appurtenance to the legend of
Orestes. The persecution of Orestes from country to country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
by his mother’s Erinnyes, in the place of human vengeance, was
no invention of poet or priest but Greek national tradition.’</p>

<p>The ‘tragic’ Erinnyes, whom we have already encountered
in the <i>Choephoroe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> find in the <i>Eumenides</i> their real battle-ground.
In this drama they have received from the hands
of Aeschylus an immortality which no mere legend or even
religious ritual could ever have bestowed. In the dramatisation
of those Titanic shapes the genius of Aeschylus found
congenial work: but what, if any, elements of the final product
were ‘invented’ by him is a matter of dispute. Miss Harrison
thinks that the Erinnyes, <i>qua</i> Erinnyes, had no special cult
in Greece. This view implies that religion, or image-magic,
had not created these monstrous forms. Müller,<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> however,
thinks that in a chasm near the temple of the Semnai Theai
beside the Areopagus there were, in all probability, carved
wooden images of the Erinnyes. But these images, he holds,
did not influence the Aeschylean picture. ‘In the outward
and visible form of the Erinnyes,’ he says, ‘Aeschylus seems
to have drawn a good deal on his invention, for the earlier poets
had no definite image of the goddesses before their eyes: and
though there were in the Temple at Athens old carved wooden
images of the Semnai, still their figures could not be adapted
for dramatic purposes. Hence it is that the Pythian priestess
after having beheld the Erinnyes is only able to describe their
forms without being apprised thereby of the nature of the
beings she had seen.’ Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> says that it was an innovation
on the part of Aeschylus to have represented the Furies
‘with snakes in their hair.’ Müller holds that this was not an
innovation, but that it was borrowed from the images of
Gorgons.<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The Furies are compared to Gorgons in the
<i>Choephoroe</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> We have elsewhere maintained<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> that it was
from the Gorgon images which, in the <i>Ion</i> of Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> are
depicted as sitting around the Omphalos at Delphi, that
Aeschylus got his idea of the ‘tragic’ Erinnyes. But in the
<i>Eumenides</i> the Pythian priestess definitely states that though
similar to the Gorgons they are not identical with them. If
they had been identical she would no doubt have recognised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
them: moreover, they are not Harpies, she says, because they
have no wings.</p>

<p>Hence we are of the opinion that Aeschylus, feeling that
he was not bound by any definite traditional form, conceived
the Erinnyes as monsters-in-general, but with a predominantly
human shape in order to prepare the way for their subsequent
transformation into Semnai Theai. In a certain still extant
vase-painting<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> which represents a scene from the <i>Eumenides</i>,
the figure of the Fury could be transformed into the image of a
respectable goddess by merely removing the snake which hisses
at Orestes, above her head! But the nature and function of
the ‘tragic’ Erinnyes are not the invention of Aeschylus.
Their form, indeed, his hand defined, but their nature and their
character had long been enshrined in traditional legend. We
have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the social, legal, and religious transitions
which led to the birth of these quasi-diabolical monsters. While
the docile Pelasgian ghosts of primeval days have many affinities
with the Semnai Theai in whose forms Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> could
discern nothing terrible or dreadful, the ‘tragic’ Erinnyes,
which are a product of post-Homeric times,<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> appear in the
rôle of avengers so savage and so implacable that they cannot
be recognised by either ghosts or gods. Thus Apollo says to
Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>:</p>

<p>We have already discussed<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the problem involved in the
refusal, on the part of the Erinnyes in this play, to recognise
the purgation of Orestes. This purgation ceremony is quite
naturally attributed by Aeschylus to Apollo, who was the
pioneer deity of the purgation-system. It could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
performed in historical times by priests or purifiers, since the
matricide had not been previously acquitted by a court.
Hence the purgation of an untried kin-slayer, which in Attic
law would have been invalid, was naturally rejected by the
Erinnyes. They say<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Yet the Erinnyes have not lost all traces of the ghost-cult of
primitive ancestor-worship and fertility-worship. We have
already quoted<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the magnificent passage in which they
promise their blessings to the Attic land. We are reminded of
primitive ancestral ghosts by the words which Clytaemnestra
(herself a ghost) speaks to the Erinnyes<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The conception of the Erinnyes as Titans is established by
comparing their frequent references in this play to Apollo and
Athene as ‘younger gods’<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> with their words applied by

</div>

<p class="noindent">We agree with Müller<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> that the ‘appeasement’ of the Furies
and their transmutation into Semnai Theai was an essential
part of the pre-Aeschylean legend. We have already suggested
the forces which probably contributed to the story of their
‘conversion.’ Beneath the religious, mythical story of a transference
of cult, beneath the story of the adoption by the
Erinnyes of the worship of the Semnai, lurks, we believe, the
echo if not the reality of legal and social evolution. The
‘conversion’ of the Erinnyes, which directly indicates the
acceptance, on the part of non-Athenian avengers, of the verdict
of an Athenian homicide court, symbolises also, in general,
the acquiescence of rebellious clans, which in the seventh
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> were deprived of material retribution in cases
of bloodshed, in the new system—the historical system—of
murder-penalties, which we have associated with Apollo and
political synoekism. The cult of the ‘Eumenides,’ who were
probably the ‘Semnai’ under a different name, we need not
discuss here. It is a religious rather than a legal matter.
It has been discussed at length by Verrall,<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Miss Harrison,<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Müller,<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and others, and we do not see that its elucidation
affects in the least the intelligibility of this play.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Suppliants’ and the ‘Seven against Thebes’</span></h4>

<p>In the remaining plays of Aeschylus there is little or nothing
which is worthy of comment from our present viewpoint. In
the <i>Suppliants</i>, the daughters of Danaus, in their efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
avoid incestuous marriage, seek asylum at Argos. They have
some difficulty in obtaining refuge there, and they feel it
necessary to describe themselves thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Exiles from the sacred land</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bordering Syria’s meads, we flee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not for guilt of murder banned</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">By a people’s just decree.<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this play the daughters of Danaus are not yet wedded
nor have they slain their cousins, the sons of Aegyptus. We
believe, however, that Aeschylus is thinking of their subsequent
kin-slaying when he attributes to them these words.
In historical Greece, persons guilty of ordinary homicide were
legally entitled to reside as aliens abroad. It is only to kin-slayers
that we can properly apply an expression which
suggests that slayers could not be accorded the privilege of
exile.</p>

<p>In the <i>Septem</i> we read of the impossibility of cleansing
kin-slaughter—an idea which we have already explained.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The reference is to the war of the ‘Seven against Thebes’ and
to the death of Eteocles and Polyneices<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough that Argive and Cadmean came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the issue: blood so shed hath power to cleanse.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But death of brothers, each by a brother’s hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That were a stain no time could purify.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Finally, the doctrine of the ancestral curse is applied to the
guilt of fratricide<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> in the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<span class="smaller">SOPHOCLES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>‘Greek drama,’ says Jevons,<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ‘owes its origin to religion
and its development to art. It is but another way of stating
this fact to say that one sign of the growth of the Greek drama
was the diminution of its religious significance.’ The drama
of Sophocles compared with that of Aeschylus is less theological
and celestial, more human and terrestrial. From the artistic
point of view it not only obeys the first alternative in the
Horatian maxim<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which we have already quoted and which
prescribes adherence to traditional story; it also follows, even
more closely than Aeschylean drama, the second alternative,
which exalts the merit of consistency. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has
attributed to Sophocles a piece of self-criticism in which he
asserts that he depicted his characters, ‘not as they are, but
as they must be’ (οἵους δεῖ). We shall not attempt to enter
into the controversy which this simple statement has evoked,<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
but we may suggest as a probable interpretation of the words
that certain ideal criteria guided the characterisations of
Sophocles. These criteria were, in our opinion,<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> consistency
and tradition. ‘The characters of Sophocles,’ says Jevons,<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
‘are bound up with his plots in an artistic and harmonious
whole ... it is equally true that his characters depend
upon his plots.’ But the plots and the characters of
Sophocles were not, we think, his own invention. They
were derived from pre-existing legend and tradition. If, then,
Sophocles did not always represent his characters precisely
as legend described them, the reason is that there were
inconsistencies in the legends. To escape such inconsistencies,
Sophocles sometimes had recourse to what we may term<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
eclecticism. If, for instance, in Homer, Oedipus, after slaying
his father, is said to have continued to rule over the Cadmeans,<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Sophocles ignored this tradition because it was inconsistent
with the sequel which post-Homeric legend indicated.<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Euripides, on the contrary, often reproduced, in one and the
same drama, various mutually inconsistent legends, and then
introduced a <i>deus ex machina</i><a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to cut the Gordian knot! Nevertheless
it remains true that not only in Sophocles, but also in
Aeschylus and in Euripides, the characters and the plots are
to a great extent based upon pre-existing legends, and these
legends are often very difficult to analyse because of the
varying influences which were derived from the ages through
which they passed. If religion is less prominent in Sophocles
than in Aeschylus, the reason, we think, is that the personality
of the dramatist selected those varieties of legends which
emphasised the human element rather than the divine. But,
for an Athenian of the classical period, there was one aspect
of human nature which was always interesting and could
never be ignored, namely the relation of man to the laws of
the society in which he lived. Fear of the laws and of the
penalties which they prescribed, a knowledge of the laws and
their administration, a habit of legal casuistry, an almost
morbid delight in legal problems, were essential elements of
Athenian psychology. To say this is to imply that the
Sophoclean drama, like that of Aeschylus, has an important
legal interest, and cannot be made completely intelligible
without an analysis of its legal aspect. Of the seven extant
tragedies, six are concerned with themes of human bloodshed.
These six plays we shall now briefly examine, from the standpoint
of homicide law. With the <i>Philoctetes</i> we have not
any special concern.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Electra’</span></h4>

<p>The plot of the <i>Electra</i> corresponds, in the main, with
that of the <i>Choephoroe</i> of Aeschylus. It is regrettable that
we do not possess the companion plays in which Sophocles
represented, dramatically, the murder of Agamemnon and
the trial of Orestes, but we may infer from the similarity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
the <i>Electra</i> to the <i>Choephoroe</i> that these plays followed
the Aeschylean model. We have said<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that the trial of
Orestes at Athens for the slaying of his mother at Argos is
not legally intelligible unless we assume that Orestes fled to
Athens with the intention of residing there, in the event of
acquittal, until such time as the avenging Erinnyes permitted
his return to Argos. But there is no evidence for this assumption
in the Homeric story,<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which merely implies that Orestes
came from Athens to avenge his father’s death. Aeschylus,
therefore, is following the Attic legend rather than Homer
when he suggests that Orestes went to Athens after, not before,
he slew his mother, and that it was from Phocis, not from
Athens, that the avenging Orestes came. In Sophocles also
it is from Phocis that Orestes comes. Moreover, we are
definitely told that Phocis had been the place of Orestes’
exile since his expulsion from Argos.<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> With Athens, then,
Orestes was not associated before he slew his mother!
Aeschylus is not quite so precise upon this point, but from
the words which Orestes utters when he arrives at Athens<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
after he had slain Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus, we cannot
infer that he had ever been there before. Sophocles, therefore,
and Aeschylus seem equally to have ignored an important
element of the Homeric narrative in their close adhesion to the
Attic legends, in which the trial of the matricidal Orestes at
Athens was an outstanding essential fact. The only reason
which we can suggest for this strange omission is the fact
that in post-Homeric times the legend was so completely
permeated by the dominant figure of Apollo that Phocis,
not Athens, came to be regarded by certain legend-makers
as the natural refuge and place of residence of Orestes before
he slew his mother. It is not, of course, altogether impossible
to suppose that Orestes had lived for a time in Phocis, and
for a time at Athens. The command of Apollo could have
been issued to a pilgrim from Athens as well as to a resident
of Phocis. But it is strange that Aeschylus and Sophocles
do not emphasise this point. The story of Orestes’ trial at
Athens must, we think, have been based, if the legend-makers
had any care for legal issues, on the assumption that Orestes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
intended to reside at Athens after he had slain his mother.
This assumption is implied in the story that an Apolline oracle
directed him to Athens for trial. The Homeric narrative
does not justify though it is not inconsistent with such an
assumption. If therefore this narrative was ignored by Attic
legend-makers, it must have been because the prestige of
Apollo had obscured the Homeric story in a variant of the
legend which we may call the Phocian legend of Orestes, and
because this variant, though not originally identical with the
Attic legend, became nevertheless at some time fused with it.</p>

<p>If we happened to possess the non-extant drama which
contained Sophocles’ account of the trial of Orestes, we feel
sure that the plea of Orestes would have been identical
with the Aeschylean plea, namely that of justifiable matricide.
Thus, in the Sophoclean <i>Electra</i> Orestes says<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, when I visited the Pythian shrine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oracular that I might learn whereby</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The righteous death-blow to thine arm shall bring.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The post-Homeric doctrine of pollution appears in the following
words of Electra, who sees in the cohabitation, within her
home, of two polluted murderers a horrible crime which well-nigh
obscures their incestuous adultery.<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">No vengeance.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The atmosphere of ‘private execution’ which characterised
the Homeric age and the earliest stratum of the pollution
era is faithfully retained. Orestes is the sole avenger: without
him there is little hope of vengeance. Electra may strike,
in the last resort, but not before she has despaired of the
return of Orestes. The deed of blood is calmly executed by
Orestes, whose conscience is salved by the command of Apollo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
The Chorus do not condemn the act. They have looked
forward to it.<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Thus they say<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">My ’wildered heart is dumb.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The desire of Electra that Aegisthus should not be buried
is clearly derived from the historical custom, for which Plato
is our sole authority,<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of refusing burial to wilful murderers
and especially to kin-slayers<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> such as Aegisthus was. The
Homeric account<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is here of necessity abandoned. Electra
says<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Sophoclean Erinnyes are even more ‘Homeric,’ and
therefore less ‘tragic,’<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> than the Aeschylean Erinnyes. In
Sophocles we do not find any reference to the Erinnyes of
the slain Clytaemnestra. This is perhaps because he conceived
Orestes’ act as clearly and unmistakably the act of
a just avenger. Hence Electra prays<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And ye, Erinnyes, of mortals feared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Daughters of Heaven that ever see</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Who die unjustly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Avenge our father’s murder on his foe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Sophocles shares with his brother-dramatists two ideas
which we have ascribed<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to post-Homeric times, namely the
notion of an ancestral curse and the notion of the blood-thirst
of the dead, as is manifest from the following lines<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The curse hath found, and they in earth who lie</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Are living powers to-day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Long dead they drain away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The streaming blood of those who made them die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To the post-Homeric period we have also ascribed<a id="FNanchor_1436b" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the custom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
of μασχαλισμός, or mutilation of the limbs of the dead, which
is mentioned in this play,<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as it also is in the <i>Choephoroe</i>
of Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The ‘sacrifice’ of Iphigeneia is also referred
to in the <i>Electra</i>. It is not described in detail, nor is it
boldly emphasised, as it is in Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But it is mentioned
as an argument by which Clytaemnestra seeks to seduce Electra
from her desire for vengeance.<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Since Agamemnon was a
murderer, she argues, surely his death need not be avenged.
In her reply, Electra utters a sentiment which at first sight
seems inconsistent with her general attitude in the play;
she says<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But grant thy speech were sooth, and all were done</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In aid of Menelaus: for this cause</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">One die for one, thou first wilt be destroyed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Justice find thee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What, we may ask, is the meaning of the ‘precedent’
to which Electra refers? Does it mean that no individual
should have the right to take human life? Does it imply
a condemnation of ‘private vengeance’ as distinct from
social justice? We do not think that the ‘precedent’ which
Electra mentions refers to private vengeance. We have
seen<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that, amongst the Homeric Achaeans, there was a
distinction, vague and unwritten, but none the less real,
which was enshrined in a public opinion of the caste, the
distinction between murder and vengeance. The act of
Agamemnon in sacrificing Iphigeneia (if we suppose for the
moment that the sacrifice actually took place) would not have
been regarded by the Achaeans as an act of murder. But the
act of Clytaemnestra in slaying her husband would have been,
and was, regarded as murder, and Orestes was conceived
as a just avenger. Hence, in this play, when Clytaemnestra
sets herself up as an isolated authority on questions of right
and wrong in matters of homicide, she is violating what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
must have been an established precedent in the Achaean
society. It is, we think, to some such precedent as this that
Electra here refers. To suppose that Electra is referring to
the precedent of ‘private vengeance’ would be to attribute
an inconsistent and illogical character to Electra, for is she
not whole-heartedly scheming to accomplish what, on this
hypothesis, she verbally condemned?</p>

<p>Finally, Sophocles does not attribute to Electra, or perhaps
even to Pylades, any actual share in the act of vengeance.
In this he follows Aeschylus, whose object it was to make
Orestes the central figure in the drama. Euripides, however,
we shall see, suggests that the act of vengeance was, so to
speak, ‘partitioned’ amongst three avengers. Both Electra
and Pylades have to suffer punishment, as well as Orestes.
Perhaps Euripides is following a legend which, while admitting
a degree of guilt, sought to lessen the guilt by dividing it.
This version Sophocles does not follow, nor does Aeschylus.
But Pylades had been too long and too well established in the
post-Homeric story to be omitted or ignored. He had come
into the story almost as early as Apollo, for he is mentioned
in a cyclic epic<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> by Agias of Troezen which belongs to the
middle of the eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The connexion of Orestes
with Pylades and with Phocis, rather than with Athens,
belongs, probably, to the Phocian variant of the Oresteian
story. This version was older, we think, than the Argive
legend which we shall find in the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides, and it was
also probably older<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> than the Attic legends which emphasised
the trial of Orestes at the Areopagus. The Attic legend-makers
should at least have followed the Homeric saga which
suggested the connexion of Orestes with Athens before his
act of vengeance; and if neither they nor the Attic dramatists
refer to such a connexion, this must be attributed to the fact
that the famous friendship of Pylades and Orestes and the
famous purgation of Orestes at Delphi had in course of time
obscured, in a fusion of legends, the previous association of
Orestes with Athens, a fact which Apollo had not forgotten
when he directed him to that State for trial and acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘King Oedipus’</span></h4>

<p>We have already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the Homeric legend of
Oedipus, and the difficulties which it presents to the legal
analyst. Homer<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> appears to think it strange that a parricide
should have continued to rule in his native land. He hints
that the dreadful deed was punished in the first instance by
pain and suffering, and later by ‘pains full many’ such as
the Erinnyes of a mother bring to pass. The story is complicated
by the addition of the crime of incest, just as the
story of Orestes is, to a less extent, complicated by the addition
of adultery. We have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that in pre-Homeric
times the deed of Oedipus was already regarded, by Pelasgians,
as at least involuntary parricide, and perhaps also, because of
the provocative action of Laius, as quasi-involuntary homicide;
and we have attributed the wonder which is expressed by
Homer at Oedipus’ continued rule in Thebes to the absence,
amongst the Achaean caste, of the distinction between
voluntary and involuntary slaying. In post-Homeric times
the notion of an ancestral curse was added to the story, and
also, if it was not already in the legend, the idea of provocation
on the part of Laius. Furthermore, the pollution doctrine
was applied to the legend, and Apollo was appealed to as the
sole judge of guilt, as he was, we think, appealed to in the
Phocian legend of Orestes.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It is strange that Attic legend-makers
did not seek to connect Oedipus with the Areopagus
court, seeing that he was said<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to have been buried in Attica
and to have been given a refuge there before his death.</p>

<p>We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that Orestes was tried by the Areopagus,
on a plea either of justifiable or of quasi-involuntary matricide,
according to the different versions of the Attic legends.
In the ‘second Attic legend,’ which is based on the plea of
quasi-involuntary matricide, for which Orestes claimed that
the penalty had already been paid, the Areopagus functions as
a ‘court of reconciliation’ rather than as an ordinary homicide
court. In the case of Oedipus there is a suggestion, in the
<i>Oedipus Coloneus</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of an informal trial of Oedipus on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
part of Theseus, King of Athens. It was probably a legendary
reference to his trial by Theseus which prohibited any connexion
of Oedipus with the Areopagus.</p>

<p>In the present play Apollo threatens to send a plague
upon Thebes if the Thebans do not search for and punish
the murderer of Laius. The penalty which is mentioned by
the oracle is of a general kind, that is, it does not definitely
imply that the crime was parricide—such an implication
would have militated against the development of the drama—but
it assumes that the slaying of Laius was an act of wilful
murder. Thus Kreon says<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sovereign Apollo clearly bids us drive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forth from this region an accursèd thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(For such is fostered in the land and stains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our sacred clime), nor cherish it past cure ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By exile or by purging blood with blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since blood it is that shakes us with such storm.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is of course possible to maintain that a penalty which
permitted the option of death or exile was the punishment
of parricide in the early stages of the ‘pollution system,’
though such an option was not permitted for kin-slaying
in Attic law. We have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> that it was not the
pollution doctrine which of itself abolished private execution,
and exile was permitted, as we think,<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> until private
execution was abolished. It is therefore legally possible that
a legend of the early pollution era contained such an oracular
penalty for parricide, in days when political synoekism had
not yet established State execution. We might be inclined
to interpret in this way the description of the oracle which is
given—but only at the end of the play!—by Oedipus himself<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His sacred utterance was express and clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>parricide</i>, the unholy, should be slain;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and he requests Kreon to execute the penalty<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fling me with speediest swiftness from the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where nevermore I may converse with men.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But we cannot suppose that the word ‘parricide’ which is
here used by Oedipus was actually mentioned by the oracle, as,
if it had been, the greatest tragedy of ancient literature, the
<i>King Oedipus</i> of Sophocles, could never have been written.
The whole dramatic evolution of the plot depends on the
suppression of the murderer’s identity. The Thebans would
not have understood such a description, seeing that, so far
as they knew, Laius had no living child. Jevons refers to
a dramatic characteristic which may help to explain this
difficulty, namely the ‘irony of Sophocles.’ He says<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>:
‘For the full appreciation of the irony of Sophocles ... it
must be remembered that whereas the torturing contrast
between the condition of Oedipus as he fancies it, and as it
really is, is only discovered by Oedipus at the last moment,
this contrast is perpetually present from the beginning to
the spectator.’ Oedipus implies that Kreon had used the
word ‘parricide’ when speaking to him in connexion with the
oracle. When Kreon replies<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> ‘Ay, so ’twas spoken,’ are we
to interpret the answer literally? If Kreon had known the
truth, he would have been compelled by religious fear to
declare it. The character of Kreon, as revealed in the <i>Oedipus
Coloneus</i> and in the <i>Antigone</i>, is that of a loyal and religious
citizen rather than that of a loyal kinsman. Hence we
must either suppose that this reference to parricide is a
dramatic slip, an instance in which the Sophoclean ‘irony’
overreached itself, or we must suppose that Oedipus and
Kreon have incorrectly interpreted the oracle in the tragic
excitement brought about by the dramatic developments of
the plot. From the legal standpoint we consider it most
probable that the oracular declaration of the penalty was of
a non-committal character. Hence it is that when Kreon
discovers the true facts of the case he decides to consult the
oracle again before taking any action. To Oedipus’ request
to drive him from the land, he replies<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Doubt not I would have done it, but the god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must be inquired of, ere we act herein....</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">In such a time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We needs must be advised more perfectly.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Does Kreon then anticipate that the second consultation of
the oracle will elicit a severer penalty, namely death without
the option of exile, which was the historical penalty for
parricide, or is he well aware that the act of Oedipus, committed
in ignorance of Laius’ identity, was, at worst, wilful
murder, and, if he hesitates to decree a penalty of perpetual
exile, is it because he is aware that the act was provoked
by Laius and was therefore quasi-involuntary? The answer
to these questions cannot be found in the <i>King Oedipus</i>
drama. The play ends while the homicide penalty of Oedipus
is still undecided. We do not connect with the death of Laius
the self-blinding of Oedipus or the suicide of Jocasta. These
events, which are referred to explicitly or implicitly by Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
we connect rather with the crime of incest. The legal analysis
of the story is complicated not only by the presence of this
crime, but also by the post-Homeric doctrine of the ancestral
curse in the house of Laius. But we hope to elicit from the
companion play, the <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, a more satisfactory
account of the legal aspect of the legend.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Oedipus at Colonus’</span></h4>

<p>Already, in the preceding play, we have been informed
by Oedipus that his act was not only not wilful parricide but
was not even wilful homicide. Describing the fatal scene,
Oedipus said<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When I drew near the cross-road of your tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A herald, and a man upon a car</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like your description, there encountered me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he who led the car and he himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The greybeard, sought to thrust me from the path.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then in mine angry mood I sharply struck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The driver-man who turned me from the way;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Smote full upon my head with the fork’d goad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But got more than he gave, for by a blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From this right hand, smit with my staff, he fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instantly rolled out of the car supine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">When the full revelation of his accursed destiny came home
to Oedipus, he was so overwhelmed with grief, remorse and
terror that he became for the time insane. But in the
<i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> he has once more regained his reason.
He argues<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> with himself and with others as a rational Theban
or Athenian of the historical era. What, he asks, was his
crime? The guilt lies with the Curse and the Fates who
accomplished it. Has he committed incest? No, for he
did not know that his wife was his mother. Why, therefore,
should he be punished? One crime only has he committed,
yet not with malice and deliberation. He had slain an old
man ‘with dark locks just sprinkled o’er with grey,’<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and
this old man was no slave or serf, but a free man and a prince.
For this deed, according to Greek law, Oedipus must become
an exile. But was the exile to last for ever? We have
quoted from Plato<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> what we believe to have been the Greek
legal penalty for slaying in a passion, namely a period of exile
which sometimes extended to two, and sometimes to three,
years, according to the degree of malice in the act. But we
have argued that in such cases the duration of the exile
depended in theory, if not in practice, on the consent of the
relatives of the slain. Now Plato says that in no circumstances,
not even in self-defence, was it lawful for persons to slay their
parents.<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Hence the legal position of Oedipus is a complex
one. Objectively, he was guilty of wilful parricide; subjectively,
he pleaded guilty to extenuated homicide. Such
complex issues were not provided for in ancient law, not even
in Plato’s penal code.</p>

<p>If therefore we find that Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> speaks of Oedipus
as ‘imprisoned’ in Thebes, and that Sophocles speaks of
Oedipus as an exile in Athens, and mentions also a projected
arrangement by which Oedipus might live near Thebes—not
in it, but just outside it<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>—may we not see in these accounts
the efforts of legend-makers to keep their creations in harmony
with legal facts, and may we not suppose that their failure
to agree with one another, and especially with the Homeric
narrative, was due to the twofold aspect, subjective and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
objective, of the deed of Oedipus? The Homeric account of the
subsequent rule of Oedipus at Thebes could only be retained,
in the ‘pollution’ era, by assuming that his act was not
parricide, but homicide, that it was not wilful, but quasi-involuntary,
and that the kinsmen of Laius unanimously
consented to his return from temporary exile. If his act
was conceived, objectively, as parricide, it would have been
necessary to assume (1) that Laius ‘forgave’ him before he
died and (2) that his kinsmen consented to his return. But
no legend suggests that Laius forgave his slayer. Furthermore,
the legends seem to have emphasised the fact that the kinsmen
of Laius were not unanimous in consenting to the return of
Oedipus. Hence the Homeric story of his continued existence
at Thebes had, in the ‘pollution’ era, to be abandoned.</p>

<p>In the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> Oedipus protests against his continued
banishment from home, because, he maintains, his deed
was involuntary. Thus, he says<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But Oedipus does not regard this attitude as sincere.
Previously, Ismene, his daughter, had warned him that Kreon
would come:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To set thee near their land, that thou mayst be</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In the opinion of Ismene, Oedipus can never return to his home;

</div>

<p class="noindent">This statement interprets the act of Oedipus as parricide
rather than as homicide, for, assuming that the act was
quasi-involuntary, the removal of pollution required, in the
former conception, the forgiveness of the dying, whereas in the
latter conception it required only the consent of the relatives
to ‘appeasement.’ Ismene implies that, whatever attitude
Kreon and the other relatives of Laius adopt, Oedipus can
never return, because Laius has not forgiven his slayer.</p>

<p>Kreon betrays a similar attitude of mind when he says<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
to Theseus that he did not think the citizens of Athens would
give refuge to ‘a man incestuous and a parricide....’ He
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Such was the mount of Ares that I knew ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That suffers no such lawless runaways</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To haunt within the borders of your realm.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen that in international Greek law exile was not
permitted for wilful parricide or, more generally, for wilful
kin-slaying, and therefore no State could open its doors to
such slayers. But for involuntary or extenuated kin-slaying
exile was recognised by law, and therefore whenever a
foreign kin-slayer applied to be admitted as an exile into any
State it was necessary to hold an inquiry, in order to discover
whether his deed of blood was voluntary or involuntary, before
admitting him to civic and religious communion. The attitude
of Kreon in the last speech is, we believe, a rhetorical exaggeration,
for it implies that in his opinion Oedipus was a wilful
kin-slayer of full guilt, and it is legally incompatible with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
previous proposal to escort Oedipus to his home. Polyneices,
the son of Oedipus, promises<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the same boon, if Oedipus
will only forgive him and help him in his conflict with Eteocles.
But Oedipus refuses to forgive his unfilial son and launches
his curse against him, because he and his brother and his
uncle are the cause of his continued exile<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis thou hast girt me round with misery;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis thou didst drive me forth, and driven by thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I beg my bread, a wandering sojourner.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, if we make due allowances for rhetorical deceptions,
we may conclude that, except in the mind of Oedipus
himself, his act was regarded as voluntary rather than as
involuntary: the oracle of Apollo took, on the whole, the same
view, but made some allowance for the element of provocation
in the act. Long before, it had foretold that Oedipus would
not return to reign in Thebes or to die there, but that in Athens
he would find rest and asylum. Oedipus quotes the oracle<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">When I should reach my bourne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And find repose and refuge with the Powers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of reverend name, my troubled life should end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With blessing to the men who sheltered me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And curses on their race who banished me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is reference in this quotation to a shrine of the Semnai
Theai in the deme Colonus. It was at this shrine that
Oedipus appeared as a suppliant for asylum and it was here
that he had to submit to a ceremonial of ‘cleansing’ which we
have already referred to<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> as a minor local purgation. This
ceremonial was probably applied to all foreign homicide exiles
who claimed the privilege of residing in a State. Orestes does
not require it when he arrives at Athens, because he has not yet
been tried and convicted, because Apollo has commanded him
to go to Athens, and because Apollo has purged him of his
guilt. The purgation ceremony in the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> was
similar to that which Croesus administered to the Phrygian
kin-slayer, as Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> records. We have said<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that,
in cases of kin-slaying, some kind of inquiry, an informal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
trial, was held to investigate the question of guilt. The
Athenians<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> here do not at first accept the plea of Oedipus,
but refer the matter to the decision of Theseus, King of Athens.
It is ultimately upon the word of Apollo that Theseus grants
him protection.<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Within the precincts of the shrine of the Semnai Theai,
there was, in the time of Pausanias, a tomb which was called
the tomb of Oedipus. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> does not believe the
story of Sophocles that Oedipus died and was buried in Attic
soil. Does not Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> he argues, prove that Oedipus was
buried at Thebes? Yet the tomb of Oedipus was to be seen
in the shrine of the Semnai! Pausanias inquired about this
curious contradiction, and he discovered, as he thinks, the
solution. The bones of Oedipus were, he says, transferred
from Thebes to Athens! Nothing could better illustrate the
credulity of the ancients and their want of historical logic.
Oedipus was, in all probability, buried at Thebes. According
to Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> he never left that city. But the doctrine of pollution,
which was applied retrospectively to Oedipus, insisted
that he did leave Thebes and that he could never return to
it. Plato implies that a person who was stained with kindred
bloodshed—even extenuated kin-slaying—could never be
buried in the tomb of his fathers. To Corinth Oedipus did
not return. To Phocis he could not go, for it was there that
the deed of blood was wrought, and we have seen<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that a
foreign slayer could never return, whether his act was voluntary
or involuntary, to the State in which the act occurred. As
a blind exile could not be expected to go very far from home,
the natural place for the exile of Oedipus was the Attic land
beyond Cithaeron. Thither legend brought him, to constitute
a further link in the eternal friendship between Thebes and
Athens! In the time of Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> just before the battle
of Chaeronea, the Athenian reception of Oedipus was put
forward as an argument for the alliance of Thebes and Athens.
In Attica legend said that he was buried, and his tomb was
there for everyone to see. But he could not have been buried
in Attica, since, according to Homer, he was buried at Thebes.
To reconcile Homer with later legend, it was necessary therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
to suppose that the bones of Oedipus were transferred
from Thebes to Athens. Pausanias, however, unfortunately
failed to see that, according to this hypothesis, the whole
structure which post-Homeric legends of the ‘pollution’ era
built round the name of Oedipus topples to the ground. The
explanation lies in the evolution of the legend. The legend
which Sophocles followed is absolutely incompatible with
Homer; and this was the ordinary and, so far as we know,
the only legend of the death of Oedipus which existed in post-Homeric
days.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Antigone’</span></h4>

<p>In the <i>Antigone</i> drama, which is rightly famous not only
for its dramatic art, but also for the problems which it presents
and the conflicts of human passion which dominate it,
there is no plain, direct and obvious matter for the student
of homicide law. But there are points of interest on the
borderland of homicide which cannot be entirely omitted.
It is easy for the adverse critic to assert that in this play
we find reference to civil war, to suicide, to judicial execution,
and to quarrels about burial, but we find no reference to
homicide. We venture to suggest that fratricide in civil war,
judicial executions of which the justice is called in question,
and suicide, are very closely related to homicide by the
similarity, if not the community, of their nature. Lysias<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
tells how, in the political crises at Athens, men were prosecuted,
sentenced, and executed as murderers who had merely acted
as informers, or as we should say ‘secret service’ agents, in
regard to that vague political crime which is called treason.
According to Pausanias,<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the Athenians accepted as a foundation
legend for the Delphinium homicide-court the story
that Theseus pleaded justification for having slain, in civil
war, Pallas and his sons who were his kinsmen. Again,
suicide and homicide, as they appear in drama, may be
closely related, since Teucer was punished by his father,
Telamon, because of the suicide of his half-brother, Ajax.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
He was even said to have been tried for this deed, for the
story of his trial is solemnly told by Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> when he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
describing the origin of the Attic murder-court Phreatto. In
the <i>Antigone</i> the judicial execution of Antigone by Kreon
is assailed as murder by his son, Haemon. The messenger
describes how Haemon attempted to slay Kreon in revenge<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">But with savage eyes the youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glared scowling at him, and without a word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plucked forth his two-edged blade. The father then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fled and escaped: but the unhappy boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wroth with himself, even where he stood, leant heavily</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his sword and plunged it in his side.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What, we may ask, caused Haemon to commit suicide? We
admit that his love for Antigone and the grief which he felt
at her loss were essential causative factors; but we also
feel that there was present in his heart an overwhelming fear
that if he survived he would slay his father. We think that
it was partly in order to avoid this horrible deed that he killed
himself, just as in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Phoenix, through fear of parricide,
fled from his home, his country and his kindred. The fact
that even for Kreon the execution of Antigone was not merely
repugnant to sentiment but was actually a source of conscience-conflict
may be inferred from the extraordinary manner in
which he caused her to die. He tells the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where human footstep shuns the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll hide her in a cave-like vault,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With so much provender as may prevent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pollution from o’ertaking the whole city.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He places Antigone in a cave and leaves with her a little
food. In his effort to avoid kin-bloodshed he proposes to
starve the girl to death! Nature and Fate can take the guilt.
This procedure of Kreon cannot have been entirely due to
the aversion which human nature, even in very primitive
societies, felt towards the shedding of kindred blood.</p>

<p>In Sophocles, Kreon is more devoted to the city than to
his kindred. Otherwise he would have permitted the burial
of the dead Polyneices without waiting for the compulsion
of circumstances. Yet we feel that if the rebellious subject
who sought to bury Polyneices had not been akin in blood to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
Kreon, he would have been immediately executed.<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Hence
we suggest that the starving to death of Antigone without
bloodshed, in order to avoid pollution, implies a latent fear
in the mind of Kreon lest her execution might be a judicial
murder, for it was when the victim was a kinsman that the
religious aspect of execution was most formidable and that
the least doubt about its justice produced the greatest scruples.
It is of course open to us to suppose that we have in this
story a fusion of ideas which are derived from different atmospheres,
and that in course of time pollution ideas became
grafted upon an earlier story which represented the peculiar
nature of this execution of Antigone as entirely due to human
psychology and tribal custom. But, in the absence of any
evidence for the existence of such a legend in early times,
we may conclude that the act of Kreon is presented in this
drama as an act which is open to the suspicion of being a
judicial murder. For such murder there was no penalty in
law or custom while the perpetrator remained in power, and
the avenger was impotent to avenge. Teiresias the prophet
takes this view of the matter and forebodes a terrible reckoning.
He includes this execution in his recital of the crimes of Kreon
when he says<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not many courses of the racing sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shalt thou fulfil, ere of thine own true blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt have given a corpse in recompense</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For one on earth whom thou hast cast beneath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entombing shamefully a living soul.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole plot of the <i>Antigone</i> really turns on the question
of the burial of Polyneices, just as that of the <i>Ajax</i> depends
upon the problem of the burial of Ajax. Eteocles and
Polyneices had fallen in mutual combat as leaders in a war
between the Argives and the Thebans, a combat which, from
the existence of blood-relationship between the leaders,
assumed the external aspect of civil war. The problem of
guilt is obscured by political complications. If we inquire
whether the mutual slaughter of these two brothers was
culpable fratricide, we must answer that, in the circumstances
of the case, it seems obvious that either both slayers wore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
guilty or that both were justified. Theseus was justified,<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
according to legend, in the slaying of the Pallantidae, and,
according to Kreon, in the <i>Antigone</i>, Eteocles was justified
in slaying Polyneices, for he commands that Eteocles should
be buried with full honours—and we know that culpable kin-slayers
could not be buried. Polyneices, however, was not,
in Kreon’s view, justified in slaying Eteocles. Here are
Kreon’s words<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">... The man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eteocles—I mean—who died for Thebes ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall be entombed with every sacred rite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That follows to the grave the lordliest dead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for his brother who, a banished man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Returned to devastate and burn with fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The land of his nativity, the shrine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his ancestral gods ... for Polyneices</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This law hath been proclaimed concerning him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall have no lament, no funeral,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But lie unburied for the carrion fowl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dogs to eat his corse, a sight of shame.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The law which is here mentioned is not an archaic fossil
recovered from an antique past. It is the law of ‘the mortal
lawgiver’ which Plato gives and which we have already
described.<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Its application in this context implies that
Polyneices was guilty of culpable fratricide, which in the
special circumstances of the case has affinities with the crime
of treason. Plato<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> gives a law which confirms this supposition.
‘If a brother,’ he says, ‘shall, in his own defence,
during a fight occurring in a sedition, kill a brother while
warding off the party who first had recourse to violence (τὸν
ἄρχοντα), let him be considered free from guilt as he is who
kills an enemy.’ In the laws of Dracon, also, as we know
from the restored inscription and from Demosthenic quotations,
the category of justifiable homicide included the slaying
of the ‘first’ aggressor and of the ‘unjust’ aggressor.<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
According to our theory that Dracon codified existing laws
but did not invent new laws, it would follow that Plato here
refers to a very ancient and for a long time unwritten law of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
the Ephetae and the Exegetae. The attitude of Kreon to
Eteocles is precisely that of the Platonic legislator. His
attitude to Polyneices seems also, at first sight, to be legally
correct, because Polyneices was technically <i>the unjust aggressor</i>.
But the tendency of legislation concerning such cases is to
condemn too swiftly, without due consideration and with a
superficial examination of the facts. Such legislation assumes
that a man must be either right or wrong, either wholly innocent
or wholly guilty. Now we find it very difficult to conceive
Polyneices as guilty of wilful fratricide. Before he became
an ‘aggressor’ he had been banished from his country,
because he refused to divide the throne with his brother
Eteocles. Was not his expulsion a prior act of aggression?
Perhaps therefore he can be regarded as fully justified<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
if one goes far enough back in one’s analysis of ‘aggression.’
But on such questions ‘justice’ is frequently a crude political
hotchpotch even in the most civilised communities. We
suggest that it is against such political ‘justice’ that Antigone
in the play revolts. It is frequently asserted<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> that this play
symbolises a conflict between religion and civil power; that
Antigone and Teiresias champion the laws of the gods, while
Kreon defends the laws of the State. But in ancient Greece
there was ordinarily no distinction between Church and
State. The State was identified with its gods. Treason was
a kind of sacrilege; sacrilege was a form of treason. Again,
it may be argued that the conflict between Kreon and Antigone
symbolises an opposition between the State law which refused
to traitors the privilege of burial, and the ancient Clan-law,
according to which the burial of a dead kinsman was a religious
duty, and its neglect a dangerous ‘sin.’ We regard this
hypothesis as much more reasonable, but if it be pressed to
its logical conclusions it compels us to see in the <i>Antigone</i>
an exaltation of tribalism over State power, or otherwise to
attribute moral weakness to Antigone. But we suggest that
tribalism had evolved the custom of refusing burial to traitors
long before the advent of centralised civic government. In
this respect, therefore, tribal law and State law were in unison,
not in conflict. Hence this hypothesis compels us to assume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
that in this play there is an exaltation of moral weakness.
There are passages in the play which support this interpretation.
Thus Antigone says<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But had I suffered my own mother’s child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fallen in blood, to be without a grave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That were indeed a sorrow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, a few lines earlier,<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> she implies that there is something
hideously novel and unorthodox about the edict of Kreon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor thought I thy commandment of such weight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That one who is mortal thus could overbear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The infallible unwritten laws of Heaven.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Haemon, too, implies<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that there is something very arbitrary
in Kreon’s proclamation. All the citizens of Thebes, he says,
repudiate the guilt of Antigone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She perishes for a most glorious deed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who when her own true brother on the earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay weltering after combat in his gore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Left him not graveless for the carrion fowl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And raw-devouring field-dogs to consume—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath she not merited a golden praise?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Hence we think that the conflict in this drama lies rather
between human nature and human reason on the one hand
and the arbitrary tyranny of civic governments in political
legislation and administration on the other. Antigone protests
against the decree which declared her brother at once a
traitor and a fratricide of full guilt.<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> If Polyneices had slain
Eteocles and had become in his stead the ruler of Thebes, how
different would Kreon’s appreciation of the facts have been!
It is obvious that sedition, faction, and civil war, whether
in ancient Greece or in modern Ireland, produce a contempt
for civic law because of the despotic dogmatism which regards
the same individual as now a patriot and now a traitor, now
a hero and now a villain, according to the momentary swing
of a political pendulum or the varying strength of political
parties.</p>

<p>Finally, we may point out that in this play there is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
veritable epidemic of suicide. But it is not suicide of the
ordinary ignoble kind. There is a clear distinction, in the
mind of the dramatist, and in the facts, which makes such
self-slaughter more akin to sacrifice. Haemon, Eurydice, and
Antigone one by one put off ‘this mortal coil.’ It is only
when it is too late that Kreon is brought to see the selfish
obstinacy of his point of view. The play ends with a warning
against impious pride. But the gods have punished the
humble with the proud! The legal analysis of suicide of this
kind is rather difficult and unsatisfactory, but we shall offer
some further remarks upon the subject in connexion with the
following play, the <i>Ajax</i>, in which suicide forms a prominent
feature of the plot.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Ajax’</span></h4>

<p>When the council of the Achaean chieftains on the plains
of Troy decided to bestow upon Odysseus the arms of
Achilles as the prize of martial valour, Ajax, the rival claimant
for the prize, was overwhelmed with jealousy and wounded
pride, and he resolved to slay Odysseus and, with him, other
Achaean chieftains. This resolution he fortunately failed to
execute, not through any fear of the consequences of his act,
nor yet through moral or legal scruples, but simply as a result
of the intervention of Athene, who directed his murderous hand
against a herd of cattle and ‘mesmerised’ him into believing
that those cattle were his human enemies. This fictitious
imaginary slaying of men cannot easily be classified from the
standpoint of historical law. Are we to regard Ajax as a plotter
of murder or a contriver of murder or as guilty of ‘attempted
murder’?</p>

<p>We have already seen that in historical Greek law<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the
contriver of murder and the actual murderer were more or
less identical, and were tried by the same Areopagus court.
Now, plotting to kill which did not succeed but which merely
resulted in wounding would have been regarded as ‘malicious
wounding’ (τραῦμα ἐκ προνοίας), whereas such plotting
without wounding was ‘attempted murder’ (βούλευσις).
From the probable fact<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that the Palladium court tried
cases of βούλευσις in the time of Aristotle, we have inferred
that this offence was punished by temporary banishment;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
for the connexion of βούλευσις with the Palladium implies
that the degree of guilt was regarded as more or less identical
with that of manslaughter, even though the nature of these
offences is very different. Now we have seen that amongst the
Achaeans of the Homeric age there was no discrimination in
regard to the penalties for murder and for manslaughter: but
are we also to assume that there was no distinction between
murder and plotting-without-wounding (βούλευσις)? The act
of Ajax, as it is described in this Sophoclean drama, was,
according to our definition of the words, an instance of
βούλευσις. Now it is possible to maintain that in this play
Ajax is regarded as a murderer, and that he would have been
punished as a murderer if his act of suicide had not rendered
it impossible to carry out such punishment. The fact that
he slew some herdmen, with the cattle, is not, we think, of
any legal importance, though the Chorus happen to mention it,
for these herdmen were either slaves or inferior serfs whose
death was not regarded as murder. In the <i>King Oedipus</i>
we are told<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> that Oedipus slew all the attendants of Laius
at the famous Phocian cross-roads, but their death was unavenged
and for their death the Delphic oracle demanded no
punishment. In the <i>Ajax</i> the Chorus proclaim the death
penalty for Ajax<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The man will die, disgraced in open day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose dark-eyed steel hath dared through mad-brained error,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mounted herdmen with their herds to slay.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again it is possible to maintain that the attempt of Ajax
was also, in a certain sense, treasonable, for it was an insult
and a danger to the whole Achaean army. Now, the penalty
for treason, we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> was ‘collective,’ that is, it applied
to the family of the traitor, not merely to himself, until the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It is thus perhaps that we must explain
the attempt which was made by the Achaean army to slay
Teucer, the half-brother of Ajax, as the messenger records<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They swarmed around him and with shouts of blame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From each side one and all assaulted him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As brother to the man who had gone mad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And plotted ’gainst the host—threatening aloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spite of his strength he should be stoned and die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But they did not slay Teucer, despite their threats, and this
fact suggests that βούλευσις (equated with murder) rather
than treason was the crime which they imputed to Ajax: for
the penalty for murder was rarely collective. In the following
dialogue between Teucer and Menelaus, Ajax is called a
murderer<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Men.</i>: Just, that my murderer have a peaceful end?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Teu.</i>: Thy murderer? Strange to have been slain and live!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Men.</i>: Yea, through Heaven’s mercy. By his will, I am dead.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet we cannot infer from the suggestion that the penalty of
death would have been inflicted upon Ajax had he lived to
suffer it, that such was the penalty for βούλευσις in historical
Attic law. It is much more probable that Sophocles is here
attributing, by an archaism, an absence of discrimination
between murder and βούλευσις to the Homeric society.<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Teucer foresees that when he returns to Salamis he will be
banished by his father, Telamon, because of the death of Ajax.
Addressing the corpse of Ajax, Teucer says<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Will Telamon, my sire and thine, receive me ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Returning without thee?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... I shall leave my land a castaway,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrust forth an exile and proclaimed a slave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We have quoted<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> from Pausanias the legend that the Attic
court of Phreatto was first founded when Teucer pleaded
innocence for the death of Ajax. Apart from the impossibility
of assuming any real historical connexion between Teucer
and Phreatto, we may naturally ask, why was it that Teucer
was presumed to have been guilty of bloodshed, and what
degree of guilt was attributed to him? We cannot very
logically apply to Teucer the principle which was enunciated
by a Delphic oracle which we have already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>:
‘Thou, who standing near a comrade being killed hast not
defended him, hast gone not pure away.’</p>

<p>Yet such oracles suggest that Teucer incurred some guilt
through not having protected Ajax from himself. The only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
explanation which we can offer for the facts is this: Teucer
was regarded by Telamon as partially culpable in regard to
the death of Ajax. In Greek law, it was necessary for the
accused to prove his innocence, and Teucer could not prove it.
Ajax had died in a solitary place; but he was more or less
insane, and he should not have been left without a protecting
escort.<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The guilt of Teucer, being of a minor kind, was
connected with that of manslaughter. The court of Phreatto
was based on the principle that the slayer who was guilty of
involuntary homicide could not have returned to his native
land until he had appeased the relatives of the slain. Therefore
Telamon, the father of Ajax, was represented in legend
as having refused to permit Teucer to land in Salamis. The
fact that Ajax was a kinsman of Teucer causes further complications.
But in the event of minor pollution the legal
aspect of such a case approximates to that of ordinary manslaughter.
We have seen that the Achaeans punished kin-slaying
by death and that they did not distinguish between
major and minor degrees of guilt. But this story of Teucer
is not, we think, of Achaean origin: it was attributed to an
Achaean by post-Homeric legend. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that
in tribal society, before political synoekism, the penalty for
kin-slaying was exile, and that tribal law discriminated
meticulously between varying degrees of blood-guilt. Thus,
the story of the banishment of Teucer can only be made
intelligible by being considered in its obviously archaic
atmosphere.</p>

<p>It remains for us to discuss the dispute which arose concerning
the burial of Ajax in this play. Ajax has committed
suicide, but there are different kinds of suicide. Plato<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
includes under the category of kin-slaying the act of a person
who ‘by violence deprives himself of his lot of destiny, without
being compelled either by a verdict of the city which decrees it,
or by a very painful and unavoidable misfortune which has
befallen him, or by being involved in a disgrace which cannot
otherwise be tolerable, but through sheer indolence, weakness
and cowardice.’ Such persons must not, says Plato, be buried
in the family tomb, or with funeral honours, or where anyone
else has been buried. Now, the case of Ajax might easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
have been included in one or other of the categories of suicide
which Plato regards as honourable. Because of his βούλευσις
he probably regarded himself as under sentence of death: he
was insane with grief and wounded pride. No one could
accuse him of cowardice or weakness. Moreover, Plato admits
that some kind of burial was accorded to all suicides. In the
<i>Ajax</i> some Achaeans demand the burial of Ajax with full
military honours, but others object to any form of burial.
Moreover, in the whole course of the dispute between the
chieftains the word ‘suicide’ is not mentioned even once.</p>

<p>Hence we cannot with any probability attribute to the fact
of Ajax’s suicide the quarrel which arose about his burial. The
quarrel arose, we think, because he was a virtual murderer and,
in a sense, a traitor. We know that in ancient society persons
who were convicted of treason were not buried, and also that
wilful murderers who had been ‘executed’ were not granted
the rites of burial. In the course of the quarrel, Ajax is called
a murderer by Menelaus,<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> a traitor and a rebel by Agamemnon.<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
It is only because of the intercession of Odysseus
that the other chiefs eventually permit Teucer to bury him.
We feel that Odysseus in this play acts as an intermediary
who is used to bring the dramatic story into harmony with
Homeric facts. In the <i>Odyssey</i><a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Ajax is depicted as
dwelling in Hades, the western Spirit-land which was a place
of repose for the Achaean dead but which could only be
entered when their bodies had been buried. If it had not been
for this Homeric reference we feel that the dead Ajax, who, by
his suicide, had become his own executioner, would, on account
of treason and βούλευσις, have been exposed to the wild
birds and the dogs.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Trachinian Maidens’</span></h4>

<p>This drama centres round the name of Hercules, and
records his tragic death under circumstances which to us
suggest the presence, at the birth of the story, of a morbid
passion for legal problematising. As we shall have to deal
with the legends of Hercules at greater length when we discuss
the Euripidean dramas which are based upon them, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
postpone for the present our general remarks about this
Hero-god. In this play there is an incidental reference to
the murder by Hercules of Iphitus, the son of Eurytus, King
of Oechalia, a deed which is mentioned by Homer.<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The
herald says<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Iphitus to the Tirynthian height</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Followed the track where his brood-mares had strayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, while the thought and eye of the man by chance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were sundered, threw him from the tower-crowned cliff.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In anger for which deed the Olympian king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father of gods and men, delivered him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be a bond-slave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now, in Homer, the Olympian Zeus takes no such action.
It is merely stated that the act of Hercules was a violation of
the etiquette of hospitality!<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The act is censured, but not
punished. But in later times, when murder became a religious
offence and legend-makers imported the pollution-doctrine
retrospectively into pre-existing legends, Hercules could not
have escaped the pollution which even Apollo was said to
have incurred when he slew the Python. And just as Apollo
was said to have served as a bondman with Admetus,<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> so
Hercules had to endure also a period of bondage. We cannot
suppose that the penalty of servitude in the ‘pollution’
religion was identical with the tribal penalty of ‘servitude’
which is sometimes found in primitive societies.<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
latter penalty was domestic and local, being regarded as a
substitute for wergeld; the former penalty could only have
been served ‘abroad,’ and it was, we think, really a consequence
of the helpless poverty of an exile. Thus it is quite
in keeping with what we may call the ‘pollution’ bondage
of Hercules that Deianira should say<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For since he quelled the might of Iphitus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We here in Trachis<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> dwell, far from our home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dependent on a stranger, but where he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is gone none knoweth....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">If it be objected that bondage or temporary exile was not the
‘pollution’ penalty for wilful murder, we may reply that
while in Homer, and perhaps also in Sophocles, the slaying of
Iphitus is presented as wilful murder, we learn from other
sources that Hercules slew Iphitus under the influence of
frenzy. According to another version of the story, it was in
Lydia, not in Trachis, that Hercules went into bondage.
Moreover, Hercules was not an ordinary, real, historical man,
and the multitudinous legends which hang around him render
him a very unsafe basis of illustration for the operation of any
law, human or divine!</p>

<p>The main theme of this play is the death of Hercules,
which, by a tragic irony, was caused by poison concealed in
a garment which his spouse Deianira had sent him in the
belief that the garment would act as a love-charm. Subjectively,
the heart of Deianira was pure from guilt, and
ultimately, but too late, her innocence was vindicated by a
discovery of all the facts. The poison of the fatal garment<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
was traced to the Centaur Nessus, who had assured Deianira
that it was a charm for waning love. The dying Hercules
sees in the fatal gift the work of destiny, and his son Hyllus
proclaims the innocence of Deianira<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She erred with good intent. The whole is said.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The suicide of Deianira prevents us from witnessing the ‘forgiveness’
of the dying Hercules, the ‘release,’ as it were,
which the revelation of her innocence would have evoked.
Instead we hear him utter,<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> while still he believes her guilty,
a ‘curse’ such as in historical Attica would have declared her
‘polluted’ by blood-guilt and would have compelled her, if
she did not prove her innocence, to become an exile or to die:</p>

<span class="smaller">EURIPIDES</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The extant dramas of Euripides are permeated with references
to homicide. It will be necessary to examine seventeen out
of the nineteen extant plays. We need not discuss the
<i>Cyclops</i> or the <i>Rhesus</i>. The Oresteian dramas will be our
first concern. In attempting a legal analysis of Euripides
we are confronted with a difficulty which is present only in a
minor degree in the case of Aeschylus and of Sophocles, namely
the difficulty of deciding how far Euripides followed mythological
tradition, or how far he ignored this tradition and
invented characters and plots which reflect mainly his own
mental outlook and the ideas of his time. Owing to the
prominence which he gives to the prologue and to the <i>deus ex
machina</i>, and owing to the frequency of his allusions to contemporary
ideas and developments, it is often maintained
that the main elements of Euripidean drama are derived from
fifth-century Athenian life, and that, therefore, the plots
and the scenes are incongruous and impossible. Thus Jevons
says<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: ‘If Sophocles laid his scenes in “a past which never
was present,” he at any rate adhered to his imaginary period
with fidelity. But Euripides lays his scenes in a time which
is neither past nor present, but an incongruous and impossible
epoch, in which Theseus defends the republican institutions
of Athens and Hecuba regrets the high price of Sophists’
lectures’; and again<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: ‘The motive seems to have been
to give as little time as possible to the myth as traditionally
related, in order to concentrate attention on the incidents and
situations of Euripides’ own making. Euripides could not
throw off the myths altogether, but he got rid of them as much
as possible by relegating them to the prologue and to the
<i>deus ex machina</i>’.... ‘Compelled<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the tradition of the
tragic art to take his subjects from mythology, Euripides was
impelled by his instinct as an artist to draw his characters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
from real life: and to present the heroes of mythology acting
from everyday motives and with everyday feelings was to
attempt in most cases an impossible fusion. The slaying of
Clytaemnestra by Orestes is a proper subject for the art
of Sophocles or Aeschylus, but is wholly unsuited to the
new form of art which Euripides was making for....
The discords<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which exist in Euripides’ plays between his
character-drawing and his situations, between his sentiments
and his mythical subjects ... are discords which Sophocles
avoided and Euripides could not or would not convert into
harmonies.’ On this subject, Verrall also holds a similar view.<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It would be obviously impossible for us to discuss this
matter with any degree of completeness, but we must point
out that we do not agree with this interpretation of Euripides.
In Attic drama, as we conceive it, it was customary for the
poet to derive the skeleton of his plots and situations from
traditional myth. In clothing that skeleton with vitality
and movement and with organic unity, the dramatist was
compelled to translate himself into the past, to reconstruct
from his data the details of speech, of action, and of character.
In a word, he consciously archaised. Now we admit that in
this vital point of ancient dramatic art Euripides is not so
correct, so unimpeachable, as Sophocles or as Aeschylus. He
could not always shake off the influences of his time. But to
suggest that Euripides deliberately set himself to create a
new form of drama admittedly incongruous, unhistorical and
unreal, seems to us, as far as we can judge, as nonsensical
as to suppose that Pheidias could have created a statue of
Olympian Zeus with an Asiatic turban on its head and ‘barbarian
slippers’<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on its feet. In our view, Euripides followed
traditional legend not only in the prologue and in the epilogue,
but also in the dramatic ‘episodes.’ To depart from tradition,
it would have been necessary and, for a dramatist with new
and advanced ideas, it would have been easy to invent new
characters, new names, new situations. In such an event,
Euripides could at least have been consistent. But since in
actual fact we find that he concerned himself less with questions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
of consistency than with situations involving surprise and
horror, with problems of human passion, and with incidents
of human interest, we must attribute his inconsistencies to
the fact that he was fettered by traditional legend and that
he overreached himself in his desire to give to the characters
of mythology a really living personality. He was, of course,
aware of variations in the legend. Like Sophocles and
Aeschylus, he had to become an ‘eclectic,’ to choose certain
elements from different stories for dramatic purposes, and to
ignore other elements. But whereas the eclecticism of
Sophocles and also to a great extent of Aeschylus is dominated
by the canon of consistency, that of Euripides is dominated
mainly by a less orthodox canon which is more conducive to
human interest and which we may call the canon of psychic
hedonism. Judged by the criterion of the Horatian maxim</p>

<p class="noindent">Euripides stands condemned if the latter alternative is applicable
to the former. But if the maxim be interpreted to mean
‘Follow tradition and if there are variations in the story
do not trouble about consistency<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> provided that every character
and every situation has a traditional basis, but if you abandon
tradition consistency is absolutely necessary,’ then Euripides
is canonical. Of the real meaning of this maxim we cannot
be certain, but to our mind it seems to mean: ‘Consistency
is the aim of all literary art, but tragedians must be guided
by traditional myth, and therefore in tragedy consistency,
though desirable, is not indispensable, whereas in all other
domains of art consistency is essential.’ Miss Harrison
and Gilbert Murray<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> have suggested a theory of the origin
of Greek tragedy which supposes, in effect, that its forms or
characteristic ‘events’ were derived from an ancient ritual
of the Year Spirit, while its actual ‘content,’ its characters,
situations, episodes, were derived from Homeric saga. This
theory we need not now discuss, but we must point out that
Homer was not the only source of ancient mythology. When
Horace says<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">he merely mentions the <i>Iliad</i> as an example of traditional
story, not as the boundary of its extent. In many instances—as,
for example, in the case of Orestes—we have suggested that
there were several variants in the post-Homeric myths.</p>

<p>Aristotle says<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of Sophocles and Euripides, Σοφοκλής
ἔφη αὐτὸς μὲν οἵους δεῖ ποιεῖν, Εὐριπίδην δὲ οἷοι εἰσίν.
This much-controverted statement is usually interpreted to
mean that Sophocles reproduced the antique mythological
atmosphere in his characters and in his plots, whereas
Euripides imported contemporary types into the legendary
background. But we find it very difficult to believe that
Euripides conceived Orestes, Hercules, Menelaus and other
heroic characters as ordinary fifth-century Athenians.<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The context in which this statement of Aristotle occurs is
very obscure. Aristotle mentions three possible ideals of
characterisation: ἢ γὰρ οἷα ἦν ἢ ἔστιν, ἢ οἷά φασιν καὶ δοκεῖ,
ἢ οἷα εἶναι δεῖ, ‘Either as (things and people) were or are,
or as they assert that they are and as they seem to be, or
as they must be.’ Now if the criticism of Euripides which
Aristotle attributes to Sophocles read οἷοι ἦσαν instead of
οἷοι εἰσίν, meaning ‘men as they were,’ <i>not</i> ‘men as they
are,’ we should be more readily prepared to accept it. We
hope to show that the characters and situations in Euripides
are often archaic, and this archaism must be attributed either
to the conscious archaising of the dramatist or to the antiquity
of the legends which he follows.</p>

<p>With this preamble we may proceed to discuss the references
to blood-vengeance in the dramas of Euripides. Once more
we will begin with the legend of Orestes. We do not possess
a Euripidean play which describes the actual murder of
Agamemnon; but the deed is attributed to Clytaemnestra
and to Aegisthus in the prologue to the <i>Electra</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Electra’</span></h4>

<p>In the <i>Electra</i> Euripides follows closely the lines
which were laid down by Aeschylus in his <i>Choephoroe</i> and
by Sophocles in his <i>Electra</i>. There are certain minor
divergencies which Verrall has indicated in the Introduction
to his edition of the <i>Choephoroe</i>, but there are also very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
striking similarities, not only in the main plot, but even in
the arguments which appear in the dialogue. We are told
that Orestes left Argos while his father was still in Troy, and
went to Phocis.<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> We do not hear that at that period he was
associated with Athens. Thus the Homeric narrative<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is
ignored and we observe, once more, the strange omission of
a fact which rendered so natural the legendary assumption
of Orestes’ subsequent trial at Athens. But the omission
is less flagrant in Euripides than it is in Aeschylus or in
Sophocles, because Euripides follows in the main a legend
which connected the trial of Orestes with Argos and not
with Athens, and though the dramatist cannot altogether
avoid a reference to a trial at the Areopagus, he refers to it in
a subordinate manner,<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> attributing, no doubt, any difficulty
which he found in understanding it to the inscrutable nature
of Apolline decrees.</p>

<p>Once more we find Clytaemnestra pleading, as a justification
for her act, the ‘sacrifice’ of Iphigeneia. The peasant of
the Prologue doubts the justice of this plea<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the ordinary
people are not in the least deceived by it. Electra repudiates
it as a dangerous fiction. She reveals the insidious nature of
the plea by pointing out, as she does also in the <i>Electra</i> of
Sophocles, that if Clytaemnestra arrogates to herself the right
to decide whether the sacrifice of Iphigeneia was or was not
an act of murder, and whether, therefore, the death of Agamemnon
was or was not justified by this sacrifice, she must logically
concede to Orestes a similar right of decision regarding these
issues, and therefore, also, the right to slay Clytaemnestra if
he considers it right to slay her!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In reasoning of this kind, which we cannot suppose to have
been included in traditional saga, we see a deliberate effort
at ‘conscious archaising’ on the part of Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
of Euripides. In the Homeric society there existed, we have
argued,<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a distinction between murder and righteous vengeance.
If this distinction had not existed in the Achaean caste the
result would have been chaotic. Instead of a restricted
system of ‘private vengeance’ which is controlled by discipline
and by public opinion, we should find prevailing everywhere
a barbarous vendetta-system. The ‘sacrifice’ of his daughter
by Agamemnon is not mentioned in Homer, and there is no
reason for assuming that such a sacrifice ever took place.
But if it had occurred, the Achaeans would not have regarded
it as an act of murder. In historical Athens such a plea as
that which Clytaemnestra here advances could never have
been made, as the legal and religious atmosphere was so
entirely different. Hence, in dramatising a legend of this
kind the correct reproduction of such arguments as those which
we are discussing demanded considerable skill. As this play
of Euripides cannot be regarded as a mere servile imitation
of the corresponding Sophoclean drama, we must suppose
that Euripides had recourse to ‘conscious archaising.’ It so
happens, as we think, that in attributing this sentiment to
Electra he has visualised correctly the Achaean attitude to
murder.</p>

<p>In the <i>Orestes</i> we shall find an argument attributed to
Tyndareus which at first sight seems to resemble the reasoning
of Electra in this passage, but which is really very different.
Tyndareus says of Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He ought t’ have called the laws, the righteous laws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">T’ avenge the blood, and by appeal to them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have driven his mother from this royal house:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus ’midst his ills calm reason had borne rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Justice had held its course, and he been righteous.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We believe that this sentiment of Tyndareus was either included
in or suggested by an Argive variant of the Oresteian
legend, and that it is based on the assumption that trials for
homicide existed <i>before</i> Orestes slew his mother. The contrast
which is drawn in the <i>Orestes</i> passage is a contrast between
social justice and private vengeance, but the <i>Electra</i> passage
indicates a contrast between private vengeance and vendetta.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
Now, in social justice such as existed in historical Greece,
from the seventh century onwards, the Achaean system of
private vengeance would have been regarded as a crime.
Similarly in the Achaean system of ‘private vengeance’ uncontrolled
and indiscriminate ‘vendetta’ was a crime. In
both cases the crime would have consisted in the violation of
the existing order. Now Euripides suggests (as we infer from
these two passages in the <i>Orestes</i> and the <i>Electra</i>) that the
consequence of such a violation is identical in both circumstances,
namely an indefinite series of murders. As applied
to vendetta we admit that this criticism is true, but in regard
to private vengeance it is false. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that such
a series of slayings did not characterise either the Achaean
or the Pelasgian system of ‘private vengeance.’ We shall
have occasion to refer to this topic again when we discuss
the problems of the <i>Orestes</i> drama.<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Electra</i> the Chorus approves of the long-expected
vengeance of Orestes. Speaking of the slain Aegisthus, they
say to his slayer, Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His deeds were dreadful: dreadful hath he felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your vengeance. With great power is Justice armed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Orestes tells Electra that, since Aegisthus was a murderer,
his body cannot be buried<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">... his lifeless corse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bring thee: treat it as thy soul inclines;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cast it by rav’nous beasts to be devoured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or to the birds, the children of the air;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fix it, impaled, a prey.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have already quoted Plato for the custom of refusing
burial to murderers. We presume that it was a legally
prescribed custom in historical Greece. The precise origin
of the custom cannot be determined with any degree of
certainty, but we associate it with the doctrine of pollution
and the evolution of State power in the seventh century. In
Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of course, Aegisthus was duly and formally buried,
even though the people of that age regarded burial as a passport
to eternal repose in the Spirit-land. It is perhaps because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
of this Homeric fact that, at the end of the <i>Electra</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the
deities Castor and Pollux decree that the body of Aegisthus
must be buried. Thus we find Euripides making use of the
<i>deus ex machina</i> to reconcile two divergent viewpoints, and
probably, therefore, two inconsistent legends.<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Euripides is distinctly non-Homeric in attributing to Orestes
a psychological conflict as the dread moment approached
in which he was to slay his mother and his cousin Aegisthus.
Such a conflict would have been natural, in Pelasgian tribalism,
if a kin-slayer refused to go into exile; but the conflict would
not have been confined to a single avenger: it would have
been diminished by the group-consciousness of an avenging
clan. Nor could such a conflict have arisen in historical times,
for the punishment of kin-slayers had, as we maintain,<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> been
assumed by the State. Hence we must regard this tragic
conflict as a piece of unhistorical conscious archaising on the
part of Euripides. The fact that the picture is unhistorical
is no doubt to be condoned in view of its dramatic value.</p>

<p>In this play Electra actually assists her brother in his deed
of vengeance. For this co-operation she is sentenced to exile
by Castor and Pollux,<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but we are prevented from regarding
the penalty as severe by the further decree that she must
become the wife of Pylades!<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is true that Pylades was
absent from the actual slaying of Clytaemnestra, but a short
time previously he was present at the death of Aegisthus,<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
although he took no actual part in the slaying. From the
standpoint of historical Attic law, he was therefore as guilty
(or as innocent) as Orestes and Electra were. Hence this
decree of Castor and Pollux must be interpreted prophetically;
they are speaking of the future, which, as gods, they foresee.
Therefore they regard the exile of Electra as temporary and
her guilt as that of extenuated matricide. That the death
of Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus involved their slayers in
some degree of guilt, in the opinion of Castor and Pollux, is
obviously suggested by the penalties which they impose.
They say to Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">With justice vengeance falls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On her: in thee unholy is the deed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Such sentiments can only be rendered intelligible by assuming
the existence of what we have described<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> as the second
Attic legend, which conceived Orestes and his friends as
guilty of quasi-involuntary homicide. Castor and Pollux are
compelled by their foreknowledge of destiny to believe that,
some day, a court will declare the act of Orestes to have
been either justifiable or extenuated; that Court they know
will be the Athenian Areopagus. They cannot understand,
perhaps, why the court should be Athenian, but they know
it must be so! From a legal point of view, nothing could be
more strange than their decree that Orestes, pending his
acquittal at the Areopagus, must leave his native Argos.
In historical Greece an accused kin-slayer awaiting trial
would only have been debarred from the temples and the
public places of his own State; he would have been tried
before a court of his own State. He would not have been
tried by a foreign court unless he fled from his own State and
sought permission to reside in a foreign State. Hence to
command Orestes to leave Argos until he was tried at Athens
is legally absurd. The only explanation which we can offer
for such an absurdity is that Euripides is following either
two separate legends or a fusion of two legends, and that he
uses the dramatic device of the <i>deus ex machina</i> to remove,
or rather to obscure, the inconsistency and the confusion.</p>

<p>Again, it is strange that, in this play, Castor and Pollux,
who, as divine kinsmen of the slain Clytaemnestra, should
appear in a diabolical implacable rôle clamouring for blood,
content themselves with the promulgation of Apolline decrees
which they do not profess to understand. We can only explain
this fact by supposing that in the story of Orestes, as it evolved
in post-Homeric times, the influence of Apollo, the pioneer
Interpreter and Purifier, was so great that no respectable local
gods could resist his decrees; and it devolved upon the quasi-diabolical
Titanic Erinnyes to unfurl the standard of revolt.</p>

<p>Castor and Pollux proclaim that, at Athens, Apollo will
take upon himself the guilt of having commanded the deed<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">For the blame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo on himself will charge, whose voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ordained thy mother’s death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">In historical Greek law the plotter and the executor of
bloodshed were equally criminal and culpable. To partition
blood-guilt was not to remove it. Therefore, if Apollo can
transfer to himself the guilt of Orestes, this can only be because
there is a doubt about the nature of the guilt. But in
estimating the nature or the extent of this guilt, the legends
seem to have been divided, some of them regarding the case
as one of justifiable matricide and others as one of extenuated
matricide.<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Similarly the Erinnyes were divided in their
opinion. Sometimes they pursue Orestes in the rôle of
avenging relatives clamouring for the trial or extradition of
a wilful kin-slayer who had fled to a foreign State with the
intention of residing there as an exile and who hoped to
secure admission by a plea of ‘justifiable slaying’; but sometimes
they seem to suggest that Orestes was not a matricide
of full guilt, that the anger of the slain was temporary and
transient, and that it would ultimately terminate in ‘forgiveness,’
because of the extenuation involved in Apollo’s command.</p>

<p>This latter standpoint is undoubtedly implied in several
passages in the <i>Electra</i>: we shall find it also at the end of
the <i>Orestes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> for Orestes is there condemned to a period of
one year’s exile from Argos and from Athens, and this penalty
can only refer to involuntary or quasi-involuntary slaying, and
presumes, in the event of kin-slaying, that the deed was either
formally ‘forgiven’ or that, at least, it merited ‘forgiveness.’
Plato<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> assures us that in such cases the anger of the dead
did not continue for more than a year. He refers to a sacred
legend which described how a freeman who had been slain
was angry with his slayer while his death was still a recent
event, and in his anger he harassed and worried the slayer,
‘using memory as an ally.’ This picture seems to us very
suggestive of the attitude of the milder group of Furies in
some Oresteian legends, but the attitude of the fiercer group
is more aptly illustrated by the following story from Herodotus
which reveals the nature of the implacable anger of the dead.
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> tells us how Cleisthenes, the tyrant of Sicyon,
was anxious to drive out of Sicyon the spirit and the cult of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
the Argive hero Adrastus, and how, to secure this object, he
established in Sicyon the hero-worship of a certain Theban,
named Melanippus, who had slain a son and a son-in-law of
Adrastus in the war of the Seven against Thebes. Cleisthenes
therefore anticipated that by the magical induction of the
spirit of Melanippus into a Hero-tomb at Sicyon he could
drive out of Sicyon the Spirit of Adrastus, because Adrastus
was still so angry with the slayer of his kindred that he could
not, even after the lapse of five hundred years, tolerate the
presence of the Spirit of Melanippus!</p>

<p>The meaning of the ‘conversion’ of the Erinnyes therefore
varies according to the dramatist’s conception of the
rôle of the Erinnyes. In Aeschylus the Erinnyes proclaim
Orestes a wilful matricide, and their ‘conversion,’ which
implies that they accept his plea of justifiable matricide, must
be regarded as symbolical of a transition in their attitude to
the social and religious aspect of homicide.<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But in Euripides
the conversion of the Erinnyes symbolises not so much a
transition as a compromise. Thus, in the <i>Iphigenia in
Tauris</i> some of the Erinnyes refuse to be placated even when
the Areopagus acquits Orestes.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> For them the issue does
not lie between wilful matricide and justifiable matricide,
but between varying degrees of extenuated matricide. Hence
they reject a verdict of acquittal, because they interpret it
not as an indication that Orestes was justified, but as an
indication that he had already suffered a sufficient penalty
for his ‘extenuated’ act of matricide. Some of the Erinnyes,
however, accept the acquittal, because they are satisfied that
Orestes has sufficiently atoned for his guilt.</p>

<p>The most severe and uncompromising attitude to the guilt
of Orestes which is found in any legend appears in the <i>Orestes</i>
drama, which we shall now discuss.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Orestes’</span></h4>

<p>The main theme of the <i>Orestes</i> is the trial of Orestes
at Argos, on the charge of having slain, unjustly, his mother,
Clytaemnestra. It would not be correct—it would, in fact,
be misleading—to assert that, as the Euripidean <i>Electra</i>
corresponds with the Aeschylean <i>Choephoroe</i>, so the <i>Orestes</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
corresponds with the <i>Eumenides</i>. The points of resemblance
between these two dramas are much less important
than the points in which they differ. In this play we find,
very strangely, a reference to two distinct trials of Orestes, at
two distinct places, in two distinct States, namely Argos and
Athens. But while the Argive trial is described at great
length, and forms in fact the chief topic of the play, the
Athenian trial is only casually referred to, in the closing scene,
as an event of the not too distant future. In the Argive trial
Orestes is condemned to death as an unjust avenger, or, which
is almost the same thing, as a wilful matricide. His act is
conceived, we think, as an act of culpable private vengeance
committed in an atmosphere of social justice. But at the
end of the play, when Apollo appears on the scene, the act of
Orestes is presented, according to our interpretation, as extenuated
matricide, which involves a penalty of temporary
exile. The words of Apollo imply that when Orestes has
served a period of one year’s exile—the penalty which was
prescribed by Attic law for involuntary homicide—he will be
declared by the Athenian Areopagus to have sufficiently atoned
for his partial degree of guilt and he will be at liberty to return
forthwith to Argos. Now these two verdicts, these two conceptions,
are legally incompatible. The verdict of the Argive
court is not found in Sophocles or in Aeschylus, and, needless
to say, it is not found in Homer; the Athenian verdict has,
however, been rendered familiar by references in Aeschylus,
in Sophocles, and in the <i>Electra</i> of Euripides.</p>

<p>Are we then to suppose that the Argive verdict was the
invention of Euripides? Such, no doubt, is the view of the
matter which Jevons and Verrall would adopt. They would
probably see in the Argive trial Euripides’ own idea of how
Orestes ought to have been tried, and in the use of Apollo as a
<i>deus ex machina</i> they would see a device by which Euripides’
idea was brought into harmony with the traditional legend.</p>

<p>But we venture to suggest, as against such an hypothesis,
that in his account of the Argive trial Euripides is not putting
before us his own conception of the moral and legal position
of Orestes. Euripides leaves us in no doubt that in his opinion
Orestes was not a matricide (<i>i.e.</i> an unjust avenger) and
that he was not worthy of death. Hence the attitude of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
dramatist is much more in harmony with the traditional
Attic legends which regard Orestes as a just avenger, or at
most as an avenger of merely nominal guilt, than with the
attitude of the Argives and their verdict of condemnation
which is the predominant feature of the drama.</p>

<p>At the Argive trial all the speakers save one solitary
individual are opposed to the death penalty, yet only one
speaker favours complete acquittal. Now it was in the
speeches that Euripides found himself least trammelled by
tradition, and if he ‘invented’ the Argive episode—including
the verdict—in order to provide, for an Athenian audience,
a thrill which the traditional accounts of the Athenian trial
of Orestes no longer possessed, why is he not consistent in
attributing to the speakers the sentiments which are expressed
in the verdict? How do we explain, on the ‘invention’
hypothesis, the fact that the Messenger, in his account of the
trial, takes the part of Orestes and condemns the verdict?
The ordinary Athenian of Euripides’ day, who regarded the
matter from the standpoint of contemporary law, could not
possibly have approved of the act of Orestes. Why does not
Euripides express this disapproval in his speeches, since he
was free to do so?</p>

<p>Again, Euripides was an Athenian democrat, and the
Athenian democratic party were anti-Spartan and pro-Argive.
In the <i>Andromache</i><a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Euripides reveals his democratic
leanings by a bitter attack upon Sparta. In the <i>Orestes</i>
he undoubtedly exalts an Argive court above the Athenian
Areopagus, but is there not a suggestion that the Argive
verdict was barbarous and unjust?</p>

<p>Again, if the Argive trial episode was the invention of
Euripides, would it not have been just as easy, and more
consistent, for him to have caused the Argives to acquit
Orestes? If he was not fettered by any tradition, would he
not have represented the Argive verdict as similar to, if not
identical with, the predicted verdict of the Athenian Areopagus?
It may be suggested, as an objection to this view, that an
adverse verdict at Argos was necessary as a prelude to the
Athenian trial, and that Euripides was naturally anxious to
include a reference to the Areopagus, out of respect for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
legends and for the prestige of the Areopagus. The actual
<i>Orestes</i> drama supplies the answer to this objection, for
it ignores, almost completely, the Attic legends of Orestes,
and it shows very little respect for the Areopagus court.
Moreover, a favourable verdict at Argos could still have been
followed by a trial at Athens, if we merely suppose that the
Erinnyes refused to accept an Argive acquittal, just as the
verdict of the Areopagus could have been followed by a trial
among the Tauri (if these people had developed homicide
courts), since in the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> the Erinnyes refused
to accept the Athenian verdict.</p>

<p>Again, it is not very flattering to the Argives (and Euripides
was pro-Argive) to represent them as condemning Orestes
to be stoned to death at one moment, and as accepting, twelve
months afterwards, a condemned criminal as their king,
simply because a different verdict had been brought in by
an Athenian court! In fact, to suggest that Euripides invented
the conjunction of two different trials, and represented
one as overriding the decision of the other—the foreign
court having the right to dictate to the native court—is to
attribute to Euripides an astounding disregard for international
Greek homicide-law. The introduction of Apollo
in order to persuade<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the Argives to accept Orestes as their
king would not be sufficient, on this hypothesis, to remove
the insult to the Argive people which is implied in the suggestion
that they are compelled to accept Athenian arbitration.</p>

<p>For these reasons then, and for others which will appear
in the course of the discussion, we do not believe that the
episode of the Argive trial was invented by Euripides. We
admit of course that Euripides composed the speeches,
because he wrote the play! But we believe that he was
guided and controlled by a certain tradition, by the skeleton
form of an Argive saga which supplied him with the fact of
an Argive trial of Orestes, with the nature of the verdict,
and perhaps with some remarks which were made at the trial.
While there are many elements in Euripides’ account which
could have been suggested by contemporary Attic thought,
we think that the skeleton-saga reflects, and therefore
probably originated in, the early historical era. The Achaean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
atmosphere is missing; Orestes was an Achaean, but he was
judged, in this saga, as the Achaeans would not have judged him.</p>

<p>The reason why Aeschylus ignored this legend was that
it obviously could not be reconciled with his theory that the
Orestes trial was the first homicide-trial in Greek lands,
it was less complimentary to Athens than the Attic legends
were, and it was too much at variance with the Phocian
legend, in which Apollo was the central figure and Orestes
was conceived as a just avenger. It was probably for similar
reasons that Aeschylus also ignored the Arcadian stories of
Orestes, of which one seems akin to the Argive variant, for it
represented Orestes as never having returned to Argos and as
having died of a snake-bite in Arcadia.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Euripides, however,
apparently found the Argive legend more interesting than
the others, though he condescends to mention, in passing,
the Attic and Arcadian variants.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>If, then, Euripides reproduces in the same drama several
different legends, without any regard for their mutual inconsistencies,
this is probably because he aimed at variety and
human interest rather than consistency, and because he felt
that he could always fall back, in the last resort, on a <i>deus ex
machina</i> to help him to maintain the appearances, if not the
realities, of consistency.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the play Electra describes, though
naturally she does not accept, the prevailing attitude of the
Argives to the vengeance of Orestes. This attitude is post-Draconian.
Orestes is conceived, not as an Homeric Achaean,
but as an Argive citizen of the historical era. He is of course
‘polluted’ even before trial, and so also is Electra. A preliminary
decree of social boycott has been issued against them
and the sentence of death is foreshadowed as ultimately
inevitable. Thus, Electra says<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the State of Argos hath decreed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And this decisive day the State pronounces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our doom, to die, crushed with o’erwhelming stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or by th’ avenging sword plunged in our breasts.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is strange that Helen, the sister of Clytaemnestra, who
would naturally have been expected to assume an attitude
of stern condemnation, assures Electra that she regards
Orestes and herself as innocent, and that she transfers the
guilt to Phoebus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee conversing I am not polluted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Charging the crime on Phoebus.<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is a suggestion of the Attic rather than of the Argive
legend in this attitude of Helen. Her words are very similar
to those spoken by Castor and Pollux in the <i>Electra</i> in a
dialogue with Orestes and the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Chorus</i>: O sons of Jove, may we presume t’ approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">And converse with you be allowed to hold?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Castor</i>: You may: no curse this blood derives on you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Orestes</i>: May I address you, sons of Tyndareus?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Castor</i>: Thou mayst: to Phoebus this dire deed I charge.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This confusion may be attributed to a conflation of ideas
which had already affected the Argive legend prior to the time
of Euripides, or it may be merely due to a lack of consistent
discrimination, on the part of the dramatist, between the
divergent viewpoints of the Attic and the Argive legends.
In historical times a person accused of homicide was not
debarred from private social intercourse. He was merely
prohibited from frequenting the temples and public places.
Plato asserts<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that there were degrees of pollution corresponding
to degrees of guilt and in proportion to the certainty of
guilt. In this case, therefore, the ‘pollution’ of Orestes and
Electra was of a minor character, since they were both as yet
untried and unconvicted.</p>

<p>Orestes naturally interprets his guilt from the standpoint
of the Attic and the Phocian legends, but he does not distinguish
very clearly<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> between justification and extenuation.
He says to Menelaus<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet have we where to charge our miseries ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phoebus, by whose command I slew my mother.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Again, he says to Tyndareus<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">See’st thou Apollo, who to mortal ears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sounds from his central cave the voice of truth?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him we obey in all that he commands:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obeying his commands I slew my mother:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drag him then to your bar, put him to death:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The guilt is his, not mine. What should I do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The guilt on him transferred, is not the god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sufficient to absolve me? Where shall man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Find refuge if the god, at whose command</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I did it, will not now save me from death?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the attitude of Tyndareus and Menelaus towards
Orestes’ act which is revealed in their conversation with
Orestes is fundamentally different. This attitude discloses a
condemnation of private vengeance from the standpoint of
social justice. As we conceive it, this attitude would normally
have been adopted by Greek States, not only in Euripidean
times but also in Draconian times. We have suggested that
Euripides is following, in the play, a post-Draconian Argive
legend—we use the term ‘post-Draconian’ merely to indicate
that the legend presumes the existence of State interference
in the trial and punishment of homicide. This legend was therefore,
as we conceive it, so historical, so ‘modern’—in a sense—that
it demanded little or no conscious archaising on the
part of Euripides. Tyndareus says to Menelaus<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If virtuous and dishonourable deeds</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The firm authority of the public laws:</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">In this passage the historical Greek system of State trial and
the historical penalty of exile for wilful murder are clearly
indicated. We need not point out how inapplicable such an
attitude is to Homeric Achaeans.</p>

<p>The manner in which social justice abolished the evils of
vendetta is thus described<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Else one must always be to death devote</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hath the last pollution on his hands.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was natural that the Greeks of the ‘pollution’ era—that
is, the historical period—should have referred to the
chaotic vendetta which their ‘fathers’ had abolished. But
the Achaean vengeance-system was not a chaotic vendetta,
because Achaean military discipline and Achaean public
opinion were able to maintain a distinction between murder
and just revenge.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> We have said<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> that it was only in the
Dark Ages of chaos and migration—that is, from 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
to 700 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—when the control of tribal chieftains, of phratry-assemblies,
and of clan-courts, and the public co-operation
of organised groups were paralysed and rendered impotent,
that the instinct and habit of vendetta was awakened from
its slumber. In the seventh century the doctrine of pollution
and the evolution of State power restored equilibrium
by the institution of the historical system of homicide law.
But it was erroneously supposed that the vendetta system
which was thus abolished had always existed in prehistoric
Greece.</p>

<p>If in historical Greece Clytaemnestra had slain her husband,
she would have been tried by a regular State-court, and, as
her husband was not a kinsman, she would have been permitted,
as Tyndareus here implies, the option of exile. But
Tyndareus does not correctly visualise the Achaean mode of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
vengeance. He argues as if trials for homicide had been always
and everywhere operative. This anachronism, at least, is
absent in Aeschylus, who could not have attributed such an
attitude to his characters, since, in his view, the trial of Orestes
was the first Greek murder-trial.<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Hence it is that the
condemnation of ‘private vengeance’ from the standpoint
of social justice does not appear in Aeschylus—nor, we may
add, in Sophocles.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Further, the suggestion of Tyndareus that Clytaemnestra
could have been sent into exile is an additional anachronism.
In historical Greece a wilful murderer usually went into
exile. But the autocratic Homeric Clytaemnestra remained
in the royal palace with Aegisthus! Thus Tyndareus again
fails to reproduce the essential elements of the Homeric story.
Now Euripides elsewhere, as we shall see, frequently reproduces
quite correctly the Homeric atmosphere. If then
he attributes here<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> to Tyndareus a non-Homeric standpoint,
it is not because he was incapable of correctly archaising,
but because he deliberately depicted a non-Homeric Oresteian
legend and attributed a non-Homeric attitude to the Argives.
The views which he attributes to Tyndareus are quite consistent
with the subsequent verdict of the Argive court, and
with the sentence of death for unjustifiable kin-slaying, which
is pronounced against Orestes and Electra.</p>

<p>There is a very archaic—an almost Homeric—tone in the
words with which, we are told, the herald ushered in the
Argive trial<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as th’ assembly sate, the herald’s voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proclaimed free speech to all who wished to speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether Orestes for his mother slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should die or not.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In historical times such a proclamation could only be associated
with a trial which was known as an ἄγων τιμητός, concerning
offences for which the penalty was not fixed by law, and for
which, therefore, the penalty had to be determined by the
court, as, for instance, the crime of Impiety.<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> We have
argued<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> that there were no homicide-indictments (γραφαί<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
φόνου) at Athens, but even if there had been there could
not have been any assessment of penalties in such cases, since
the penalties for homicide were fixed by law from time immemorial.
It is therefore, we believe, from the Homeric
ἀγορά rather than from the Athenian Heliastic courts that
Euripides received his inspiration for such a proclamation.
Moreover, his description of the composition and of the general
procedure of this Argive court is very Homeric, and reminds
us very forcibly of other archaic pictures in Greek drama,
such as the Council of Achaean chieftains in the <i>Ajax</i> of
Sophocles,<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and the Assembly of the Greeks who condemn
to death Helen<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and Polyxena.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is a herald who conveys
the death-sentence pronounced by the Greeks against Astyanax,
in the <i>Troades</i><a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of Euripides. Thus we have in this play
a strange mixture of the archaic and the historical. We
sometimes feel as if the Achaean atmosphere had momentarily
reappeared in the Draconian age, as if Homeric heroes had
been suddenly transformed into historical Argives, without,
however, having completely divested themselves of their
Homeric usages.</p>

<p>Pollux assures us<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that at the Athenian Areopagus it
was not permitted to appeal to pity or to indulge in rhetorical
persuasion, but it was necessary for the plaintiff and the
defendant to confine themselves to the issues of guilt or
innocence. Similarly, we may assume, at the Delphinium
court no discussion of general principles would have been
admitted, but merely evidential statements of fact. But
at the Argive trial in this play there is no attempt at an
investigation of facts. The speeches are entirely concerned
with general principles. It is impossible to maintain that
Euripides is explaining, in this trial, his ideas, based on contemporary
practice, of the manner in which Orestes ought
to have been tried.</p>

<p>Talthybius, the ubiquitous herald, sets his sails to the
wind, but he cannot, unfortunately, decide how the wind is
going to blow. He does not approve of the vengeance of
Orestes, because, he says,<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> it establishes a bad precedent in
regard to parents. This viewpoint ignores the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
between murder and vengeance. Orestes is conceived as a
matricide, pure and simple, and being a matricide his guilt
is greater than that of Clytaemnestra. It is regrettable, of
course, that Agamemnon was slain, but Clytaemnestra, his
slayer, was not his daughter, but only his wife! The Erinnyes,
in Aeschylus,<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> advance a similar argument, but in the <i>Orestes</i>
such reasoning is more logical because the Argive court interprets
the vengeance of Orestes as an act of barbarous vendetta
and assumes that such a mode of vengeance was already
obsolete and unlawful in his time. It is only by assuming that
Orestes and Clytaemnestra were both criminals that one
can logically compare the act of Clytaemnestra with that of
Orestes and maintain that the act of Orestes was, because of
blood relationship, more criminal than that of Clytaemnestra.
It is thus that Hesiod,<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> living in an age of chaotic vendetta,
would have singled out for special condemnation the shedding
of kindred blood. In the Aeschylean drama, on the other
hand, and therefore, as we think, in the Attic legends of
Orestes, ‘private vengeance’ is not definitely and dogmatically
assumed to have been obsolete and unlawful in the time of
Orestes. There is of course a doubt about the matter such
as would naturally have arisen amongst legend-makers of the
transitional seventh century. This doubt is, naturally enough,
availed of by the Erinnyes of the slain. But Apollo has no
doubt about the matter. In the interests of justice he commands
a ‘private’ avenger to avenge.</p>

<p>After Talthybius, Diomedes utters a speech<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> in which
he attributes the guilt of matricide not only to Orestes but
also to Electra, and proposes not indeed that they should
be put to death, but that they should be banished from the
city of Argos. He suggests, very curiously, that the death
penalty would be impious! It is difficult to find any legal
justification for this view. It is quite possible that Euripides
is depicting for dramatic purposes, with a complete disregard
for law, a variety of possible penalties. In Attic law a criminal
who was convicted in a matter of grave import was punished
by a general penalty of ἄτιμία, or loss of citizen rights;
in some cases, such as parent-slaying, this degradation of
civic status involved death and confiscation of property: in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
other cases, such as sacrilege, it involved death without confiscation;
in ordinary wilful murder, it involved either death
or banishment and confiscation, and in cases of malicious
wounding the penalty of ἄτιμία denoted simple banishment
without confiscation. It may be, then, that Euripides is
applying such a gradation of penalties<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> to a period when the
penalties for crime were not rigidly fixed.</p>

<p>If we suppose that in this speech of Diomedes Euripides
is consciously archaising, his archaism is not very felicitous.
For kin-slaying amongst Pelasgian clans, we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
the normal penalty was exile: for kin-slaying amongst the
Achaeans, the penalty was death. In historical times, when
private vengeance gave place to State execution, the penalty
was invariably death. Hence, Diomedes’ reference to impiety
can become legally intelligible only if it is interpreted according
to the standpoint of the tribal renaissance of post-Achaean
days, when the group-system resumed its sway. From such
a standpoint the act of the Achaean Orestes would have been
viewed as matricide by the Elders of the tribe and in the
public opinion of the clans. If a tribal court sat in judgment
on Orestes in, say, the year 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and discussed the penalty
which his act deserved, it would have been natural to suggest
the exile penalty which was the normal punishment for kin-slayers.
If then Euripides has been so very subtle in his
archaising as to have attributed this proposal to the Argive
Diomedes, he might at least have selected for the mouth-piece
of this utterance someone whose name was not so inextricably
connected with the Achaean domination!</p>

<p>After Diomedes, there rises up a bold bad man whom the
messenger describes as ‘an Argive who was not an Argive’<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
and who is generally supposed to typify, in Euripides’ view,
the Athenian demagogue Cleophon.<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> His speech, we are told,<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
had been previously prepared for him by Tyndareus, who,
though the nearest kinsman of the slain Clytaemnestra, does
not speak at all at this assembly! His nameless subordinate,
however, proposed<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that Orestes and Electra should be stoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
to death. This was the opinion which in a modified form
the assembly ultimately adopted,<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> though only one speaker
actually proposed it. Orestes succeeded in obtaining his request
that he, together with his sister Electra, should be allowed
to end their own lives in a respectable manner.</p>

<p>The penalty of death by stoning is not mentioned in Homer,
in Attic law, or in Plato’s laws. Was it, then, mentioned in
an Argive legend or did Euripides invent it? The penalty
may have existed in the antique system of tribal vengeance.
Plato assures us<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> that the slayer of a parent or a kinsman was
stoned, <i>after death</i>, by the judges and the magistrates. This
custom was probably a survival of the more primitive custom
of stoning criminals to death. If the Argive legend of Orestes
did not mention such a penalty, Euripides is either archaising
on the basis of this survival or is importing into the drama
an idea which he derived from the crude customs of outlying
‘barbarian’ lands.</p>

<p>The sentence of the Argive court permitted suicide as
an alternative to execution. We do not know of any legal
basis for this option. We have no reason to doubt that
suicide was always in practice, if not in theory, accepted as
an alternative for execution in historical Greece. Here,
however, the theory is accepted by a homicide-tribunal.</p>

<p>Before the verdict of the court was given, a nameless man,
for whom Euripides clearly feels much admiration,<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> a small
farmer by occupation, proposed to crown Orestes because
he avenged his father by slaying his impious mother, whose
adulterous criminality was fatal, he said, to the interests of
a martial or militaristic society. We have said<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> that the
legal aspect of the vengeance of Orestes is complicated to
some degree by the fact that his mother was an adulteress.
We have argued<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that death was not the regular penalty
for adultery in Greek tribal life, and we do not think that
the Achaeans, like the German tribes, followed a sterner code.
It is difficult to derive any deductions either in regard to
homicide or to adultery from this argument, because adultery
and murder are mentioned in conjunction. The following
words of the nameless speaker<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> seem, however, to imply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
that adultery required a more serious punishment than that
which custom sanctioned:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A similar conjunction of murder and adultery is revealed in the
words of Orestes,<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> who poses as a pioneer in the application
of the death penalty to adultery:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In Aeschylus and in Sophocles the only plea of justification
which Orestes advances is the command of Apollo. But in
the Euripidean account of the Argive trial Apollo is not
mentioned at all. We cannot explain this strange fact by
supposing that it would have been unprofitable to refer to
him because at the end of the play the decree of Apollo
is accepted without question by the Argives. We cannot
suppose that Euripides, in his conscious archaising, is trying
to visualise a pre-Apolline Court, as he would probably, in
such a case, have ignored Apollo completely and avoided
all references to pollution. The most satisfactory and, to
our mind, the most obvious explanation of the absence of
any reference to Apollo at the Argive trial is this: Apollo
appears in the Oresteian legends in the rôle of justifier and
purifier. Such a rôle is consistent only with the conception
of Orestes as an avenger of partial guilt or as an entirely
justified avenger. It is quite irreconcilable with the theory
that Orestes was a wilful matricide of full guilt. Now, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
verdict of the Argive court conceived Orestes as a guilty
matricide worthy of death. The only speaker who approves
of his act does so not because he was a just avenger, but
because his mother was an adulteress. To introduce Apollo
into a court of this kind would have been to expose him to
ridicule and contempt. Hence the attitude of the Argives
to Orestes, whether invented by Euripides or, more probably,
as we think, enshrined in an Argive legend, made it impossible
to connect Apollo with this Argive trial.</p>

<p>In the above quotation Orestes poses as a pioneer in the
stern punishment of adultery. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> suggested
what we consider to have been the evolution of the penalties
of adultery in Greece. We have quoted Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> for the
view that, at first, adultery was leniently treated. A certain
Hyettus, he says, first punished it by death, and Dracon finally
legalised the death penalty, but only for adultery <i>in flagrante
delicto</i>. We believe that this plea of Orestes was the invention
of Euripides. Seeing that he could not permit any reference
to Apollo at the Argive trial, he had to invent a new plea.
But ancient law shows no regard for pioneers. Until the law
is changed the pioneer reformer is a criminal. In our opinion,
Greek law never adopted the penalty for adultery which,
according to Orestes, it ought to have adopted.</p>

<p>In this quotation Orestes refers<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> to a law upon which
he seems to rely for his acquittal. ‘If you require my life,’
he says, ‘the law hath lost its force.’ It is obvious that he
is not referring to any law which the Argives recognise, for
otherwise they would have acquitted him. Yet he suggests
that such a law exists somewhere. We cannot suppose that
he is referring to an actual law which prescribed the death-penalty
for adultery, since he is definitely represented, like
the nameless farmer, as endeavouring to persuade the Argives
to adopt a code of penalties for adultery which would be more
conducive to martial efficiency than the existing system.
In the <i>Troades</i> the Achaean army conferred on Menelaus
the right to slay the adulterous Helen. But this fact implies
that no existing law would have justified such a slaying.
Moreover, there was nothing in contemporary Attic law or
social custom to suggest to Euripides that murder and adultery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
in conjunction could be legally punished by death. Yet the
law which Orestes mentions implies the legality of such a
punishment somewhere. We cannot suppose that Euripides
is indicating a contrast between Athenian and Argive legislation,
for, so far as murder is concerned, we believe that their
laws were similar. The explanation which we propose to offer
for this peculiar reference is an alternative one, such as we
have suggested in regard to the speech of Diomedes in the
play. We believe that the law which Orestes mentions is
either a pure fabrication of Euripides’ mind, derived from the
supposition that archaic penalties were more severe than the
penalties of contemporary law, or an instance of conscious
archaising, in which Euripides attributes to an Homeric
Achaean a discrimination in certain cases between murder and
just revenge. The former alternative is rendered somewhat
improbable by the fact that the Argives do not recognise the
legality of this ‘archaic penalty.’ The latter alternative is
therefore the more probable and suggests, if it is correct, that
Euripides could sometimes be very subtle and, at the same
time, successful in his archaising. According to this theory,
Orestes suggests that he is justified by a law of the Achaean
caste. But the Argives, who reflect the viewpoint of historical
social law, reject a plea of justification which would compel
them to recognise the legality of private vengeance.</p>

<p>Between the conclusion of this trial of Orestes at Argos
and the appearance of Apollo as a <i>deus ex machina</i> at the end
of the play there occur some exciting incidents, such as the
seizure of Hermione as a hostage and the murder of Helen<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
by Orestes. Apart from the fact that Menelaus, her husband,
is very angry and vindictive, no one else seems to take much
interest in the death of that famous woman who lived (and
died!) in so many places.<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The argument used by Pylades
to Orestes in urging the death of Helen is very unscrupulous.<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
‘Slay Helen,’ he says, ‘and people will forget that you slew
your mother.’ The slaying of Helen was really murder, but
Apollo ignores it. Legally, it does not exist. Legally, its
presence in the <i>Orestes</i> is a grotesque anomaly. But it has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
at least this value: it shows us how little Euripides cared
for the legal aspect of a story as compared with its dramatic
vitality. When Apollo comes on the scene, Orestes is in the
act of setting fire to the royal palace at Argos. Orestes’
threats of incendiarism, his use of Hermione as a hostage, and
the murder of Helen have delayed the doom which was pronounced
by the Argives until Apollo comes! But when he
comes,<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> how different is the picture! The conception of
Orestes’ vengeance is completely altered. In an instant we
pass from wilful matricide to quasi-involuntary matricide.
We breathe once more the atmosphere of the Attic legend
which we find in the <i>Electra</i>. Apollo is not consulted about
the problem which had occupied, throughout the play, the
attention of the Argive court, namely the question whether
Orestes pursued an obsolete course of unlawful vendetta and
obeyed the dictates of an Achaean system of vengeance which
a later system of social justice had superseded, or whether
he did not. The only problem which confronts Apollo is
the question how he will most easily persuade the Argives,
and the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra, to recognise the fact
that he, Apollo, commanded Orestes to slay his mother and
that, therefore, Orestes’ act was either justified or at least
extenuated.</p>

<p>The contrast in this drama between the attitude which
Apollo adopts in regard to Orestes and the attitude which the
Argives adopt is so obvious and important that the legends
which incorporated these attitudes could never have been
reconciled. No Athenian with an interest in legal problems
could ever have thought of them together without mentally
contrasting them. But these legends, namely what we have
called the Argive and the Attic legends, are both found in
juxtaposition in this drama, and Euripides is naturally compelled
to make use of Apollo as a <i>deus ex machina</i> in order to
produce a nominal appearance of dramatic unity. Euripides
could not have ignored altogether the Attic legend. He was
an Athenian, not an Argive. The <i>Electra</i> could have been
written without any reference to the Areopagus, but the
<i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> could not. Thus, whether he is condemned
or acquitted at Argos, Orestes must in either event<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
go to Athens! But before he goes to Athens, Orestes must
go into exile for a year in Arcadia.<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Two problems now
arise: (1) Why is one year the limit of the exile-period?
(2) Why is this exile spent in Arcadia? The first question can
only be solved by a reference to the <i>Laws</i> of Plato. In the
<i>Laws</i><a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Plato assures us that there was a fixed penalty of
one year’s exile which was applicable only to the following
homicide cases: (1) involuntary homicide; (2) slaying in a
passion (in which we include quasi-involuntary or extenuated
homicide), if the dying person ‘forgave’ his slayer; and
(3) quasi-involuntary kin-slaying, if the slayer was ‘forgiven.’
Of these three possible cases, only the last can be relevantly<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
applied to the slaying of Clytaemnestra by Orestes. Legally
therefore it is necessary to regard the act of Orestes as quasi-involuntary
matricide if we wish to explain the penalty which
Apollo decrees at the end of the play. When Orestes has
served a period of one year’s exile, he will be ‘acquitted’ by
the Areopagus.<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> We cannot interpret this acquittal as a
verdict of ‘not guilty,’ since on this assumption the preliminary
penalty of one year’s exile becomes either meaningless or
unjust. It is a curious kind of ‘acquittal,’ since it is intended
to imply that a certain degree of guilt has now been sufficiently
atoned. In the Attic homicide-code there is no reference to
an acquittal of this kind, but Plato mentions something
which suggests that such an acquittal was a legal possibility.
Speaking of extenuated homicide, Plato says<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that ‘when
the period of exile shall have expired, it is right to send twelve
judges to the borders of the State that ... they may judge of
the pity to be shown and of the return (of the exiles to their
home-land).’ Now Apollo in this play says<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that Orestes
will be tried by gods, not by men, at Athens. Demosthenes
gives the tradition more explicitly when he says<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that ‘the
twelve gods judged between Orestes and the Erinnyes.’</p>

<p>We have said that there were two Attic legends of Orestes,
that one of these represented him as tried by the Areopagus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
on a plea of justifiable matricide, and the other, on a plea of
quasi-involuntary matricide. There is some difficulty involved
in connecting the Areopagus with either of these pleas. In
regard to the first we must assume that the Areopagus in
early times tried pleas of homicide between strangers which
were normally tried by the Delphinium. In regard to the
second plea, we suggest that it is necessary to suppose that the
ancient Areopagus would have tried pleas of involuntary and
quasi-involuntary homicide which normally came under the
jurisdiction of the Palladium court and of minor local
courts. It is therefore, we must assume, in the unusual rôle
of a reconciling court that the Athenian Areopagus ‘acquitted’
Orestes in the ‘second Attic legend.’ That he was not satisfactorily
‘acquitted’ will be manifest<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> when we discuss the
<i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>. Orestes had to leave Athens and to
undergo still further wanderings as an exile, because all the
Erinnyes did not recognise his ‘acquittal.’ We have already
suggested<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that the Erinnyes in the Oresteian legend frequently
symbolise the conflict of opinions which sometimes
preceded the consent of the relatives of the slain to accept
‘appeasement’ in cases of involuntary and quasi-involuntary
homicide. The court to which Plato refers in the passage
cited above was a ‘court of reconciliation.’ The ‘twelve
judges’ whom Plato mentions may have been suggested by
the ‘twelve gods’ who judged between the Erinnyes and
Orestes. Such myths and such ‘courts of reconciliation’
made it possible, we believe, for the creators of the ‘second
Attic legend’ to connect Orestes with the Areopagus.</p>

<p>It is not easy to explain why Euripides selected Arcadia
as the place of exile for Orestes. First of all, there seems
to have existed an Arcadian variant of the Oresteian legend
which associated Orestes with Arcadia and maintained that he
actually died there.<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> One of the Arcadian towns was called,
from Orestes, ‘Oresteum.’ Again, it is possible to suppose
that Euripides, who, in this drama, reveals a certain desire for
originality, should have selected Arcadia because Aeschylus
and Sophocles had exalted the association with Orestes of
Athens and of Phocis, and had entirely ignored Arcadia.
But there may also have been a religious or quasi-legal fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
behind this idea of Euripides. We have seen that, in Attic
law,<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> a homicide-exile was debarred (<i>a</i>) from his native
place, (<i>b</i>) from the country of the slain, (<i>c</i>) from the State in
which the deed took place. The basis of these legal facts was
sentimental or religious. It was supposed that the spirit of
the slain was not merely intolerant of the presence of the
slayer in civic proximity to his burial-place, but was also
indignant at the thought that the slayer should be enjoying
himself, as it were, and not suffering any real hardships as a
punishment for his crime.<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Now, Argos was of course
forbidden ground to the exiled Orestes. But one legend
said that he had lived in Athens, another that he had lived
in Phocis, before he slew his mother. In these places he had
made friends and companions. In these places exile would
not have involved for him sufficient hardship and suffering.
Arcadia, however, held no attraction for Orestes, and hence
it was to Arcadia that the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra desired
that he should go.</p>

<p>We can therefore, in the light of these conclusions, understand
in their full meaning the words of Apollo to Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>:</p>

<p class="noindent">After the lapse of a single year and after his ‘acquittal’ by
the Areopagus, Orestes may again return to the city of Argos.
This return is announced prophetically by Apollo to Menelaus,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Problem of Pylades</span></h5>

<p>We may now consider a problem concerning Pylades which
is presented by this drama. As in Aeschylus and in Sophocles,
so in Euripides, Pylades co-operates with Orestes in avenging
Agamemnon. But in Euripides the guilt of Pylades is more
clearly emphasised. Hence, we hear for the first time that
he is punished. He tells Orestes<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My father in his rage hath banished me.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We saw that in Greek law the plotter, the co-operator, was as
guilty as the actual slayer.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Hence the problem of Pylades’
guilt depends on that of Orestes’ guilt. If therefore Strophius,
the King of the Phocian land, punishes Pylades <i>pendente lite</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
we attribute this to the autocratic power of a king on the one
hand, and on the other to the general principle of Greek law
that an accused person was presumed to be guilty until he
had established his innocence.<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Now, in the <i>Electra</i><a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Castor
and Pollux declare that Electra will marry Pylades and that
he will take her to his home, but there is a suggestion that
a brief period of time, probably one year, must elapse before
this event takes place. We presume that he would be permitted
by his father to return, in obedience to the divine decree.
In the <i>Orestes</i> he is still an exile from his home, as the guilt
which he shares with Orestes has not yet been atoned by exile.
But has he any legal right to remain in Argos? Orestes warns
him that his life is in danger there, but Pylades replies that
the Argives have no power to punish him<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They have no right: I am no subject here.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which of these opinions is correct—that of Orestes or that
of Pylades? We have shown<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that, in Greek law, accused
and convicted slayers were debarred from three possible
States, of which one was the State of the deceased. Demosthenes
says<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>: ‘The boundary-line for all homicides is exclusion
from the country of the deceased ... from everything
in which the deceased in his lifetime had a part.’ We
cannot of course suppose that this law applied to unconvicted
slayers, but we may presume that they were at least debarred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
from the temples and the public places of the State. Hence
we can reconcile these two opinions by assuming that Orestes
is referring to the public aspect and Pylades to the private
aspect of residence at Argos. When Pylades asserts that he
deserves to suffer at Argos,<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> he is referring to the period
which follows the trial of Orestes, which involved, we presume,
a condemnation of Pylades. Menelaus asks if Pylades had a
share in the slaying of Helen, and leaves us in no doubt that
his life is forfeit in Argos.<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> We have quoted<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Plato in
support of the assertion that strangers were liable to more
serious penalties for homicide than natives were. But this
assertion only applies to convicted slayers. Hence it is
possible to accept the suggestion of Euripides that Pylades
was not imprisoned at Argos, as Orestes was, and that he
visited Phocis before the trial of Orestes.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Problem of Orestes’ Pollution</span></h5>

<p>From what has been said it will be obvious that Orestes
is more ‘polluted’ in Euripides than he is in Aeschylus or in
Sophocles. The ‘pollution’ of a person who was conceived
as guilty of wilful and unjustified matricide was the greatest
and the most horrible kind of ‘pollution,’ and it is this
conception of Orestes which predominates in this Euripidean
drama. At the end of the play the pollution of Orestes is
miraculously diminished. This is because Orestes is here
conceived not as a wilful matricide of full guilt, but as a quasi-involuntary
matricide who transfers the main portion of his
guilt to Apollo. In Greek law an extenuated act of homicide
produced, even when the dying person ‘forgave,’ a minor
temporary ‘pollution,’ which continued until the slayer had
endured a minimum period of one year’s exile and had
appeased the relatives of the slain. During this period of
exile the slayer had to abstain from three possible States,
which we have already defined. But a kin-slayer was in a
peculiar position. Until the fact of involuntariness was
established before a court he was liable to be regarded as
polluted wherever he went. In Arcadia Orestes was not
‘polluted,’ according to Euripides, perhaps because Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
commanded him to go there, perhaps because his residence
there did not create any special anger on the part of the slain
Clytaemnestra. But in Argos he would have been polluted,
because Argos was his native State and could not therefore
have been for him a place of exile even if he had been guilty
of involuntary homicide, and not, as he was, of involuntary
kin-slaying. In Athens, too, he would have been regarded
as polluted until he had been tried, especially if he was accused
(as he was accused, by the Erinnyes) of wilful kin-slaying;
but his pollution would have been that of an untried criminal,
and therefore public rather than private. We shall see in
the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> that he was, in a certain sense,
polluted when he came to Athens for his trial, and the Athenians
based upon this ‘pollution’ an explanation of a peculiar
ritual of which the origin was obscure, namely the Feast of
the Pitchers (χόες) at the Anthesteria.<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Now in Aeschylus
and in Sophocles the predominant conception of Orestes is
that of an unconvicted matricide who pleads justification for
his act; and if we find, in addition, the conception of Orestes
as a quasi-involuntary matricide, this does not affect to any
great extent the question of Orestes’ pollution, because Orestes
has already atoned for the guilt of extenuated matricide.
He has actually been purged by Apollo himself, and he is still,
so far as Athens is concerned, untried and unconvicted, and
therefore his pollution is minor and merely ‘public’—that is,
he is forbidden to frequent the temples or public places
but he is free to associate privately with his fellow-men. In
Euripides, however, Orestes is convicted of wilful matricide
by an Argive court. His pollution is therefore technically so
great that no Greek city could receive him. If his pollution is
subsequently reduced to the minor pollution of involuntary
kin-slaying, this is only because Apollo acts not as a purifier,
but as a dramatic <i>deus ex machina</i> who does miraculous and
impossible things.</p>

<p>Wedd, in his edition of this play, proposes a strange explanation
for the graver pollution of the Euripidean Orestes,
which is based, as we think, on a false interpretation of the
dramatic ideals of Euripides. ‘In Sophocles,’ he says,<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> ‘all
men will honour Orestes, in Aeschylus he is welcomed as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
deliverer, in Euripides the whole State rises up in horror
against him ... in Aeschylus, although Orestes flies for his
first purification to Apollo, many others aid in freeing him from
guilt and he associates with thousands in harmless intercourse;
in Euripides all doors are shut against him, all speech is denied
him, none will perform the purifying rites for him; the full
rigour of Athenian law, which refused to the parricide alone
among murderers the right of escaping death by flight, is
exercised against him ... the attitude of the whole State
towards the matricide, the feeling of the murderers themselves
with regard to their own act, are precisely what would be expected
if in modern (? fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) Athens two children
were induced by an oracle to take the law into their own
hands and put their mother to death.’</p>

<p>This account of the facts is fairly accurate, but it suggests
that the Euripidean Orestes is a definite unitary personality,
whereas we have shown that there are at least two different
conceptions of Orestes in this play. The ‘full rigour of
Athenian law’ is certainly apparent in the Argive verdict,
but Wedd assumes that Euripides, in this play, adopted
towards Orestes an attitude which ignored Homer and the
Attic legends made familiar by Aeschylus and Sophocles, and
which paid no attention to Apolline decrees. In this respect
the account is misleading. It is based on an erroneous conception
of Euripides. According to Wedd, Aeschylus and
Sophocles adopted towards Greek legends an attitude which
was quite different from that which Euripides adopted. These
two dramatists accepted, he thinks, the legends in their main
outline and sought to reproduce them as far as possible in
their archaic setting, with the least possible admixture of
‘historical’ ideas. Euripides, on the contrary, adopted a
critical attitude to the myths and made it his object <i>not</i> to
reproduce them for their own sake but to contrast them with
the more enlightened feeling of his own time. This interpretation
of Euripides is very similar to that of Jevons which we
have already discussed.<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The arguments which we adduced
against Jevons are therefore applicable to Wedd, but we offer
here an additional criticism which is more definitely concerned
with the <i>Orestes</i> drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span></p>

<p>According to Wedd’s hypothesis, the trial of Orestes at
Argos which is described in this play contains the Euripidean
conception of the manner in which the myth should have
regarded Orestes. We admit that the viewpoint of the Argive
court is in the main historical; by an anachronism it identifies the
world of Orestes with that of the Argives of the historical era.</p>

<p>But the existence of an Argive legend which despite its
lack of archaism<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> was of considerable human interest would
explain Euripides’ description of such a trial. The fact that
at the end of the play<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the resultant verdict of the trial is
ignored and reversed suggests rather that Euripides regarded
the Attic legend as more archaic and therefore more correct
than the Argive legend. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> pointed out that
the Messenger’s description of the trial and the opinions of
some of the speakers at the trial are more suggestive of the
dramatist’s own views than is the verdict of the Argive court.
According to Wedd, the <i>real myth</i> occurs at the end of the
play, and the rest of the play is the invention of Euripides.
Euripides did not agree with the mythical presentation of
Orestes, so he invented a new version which he deliberately
set in emphatic contrast to the obsolete Attic myth! In our
view, Euripides reproduces two pre-existing legends—an Attic
and an Argive legend of Orestes. The Argive legend he
regarded as more dramatic, the other as more orthodox but
less replete with human interest. According to Wedd, the
graver pollution of the Euripidean Orestes is due to the fact
that Euripides conceived him as a fifth-century Athenian.
For us, the different degrees of pollution in Orestes are due
to different conceptions of Orestes’ guilt or to the different
legal and religious attitudes of the legends which the dramatists
followed. They are not to be attributed to any distinction in
the attitude of the dramatists to the legends themselves. The
contrast is in the legends, not in the dramatists.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Erinnyes in Euripides</span></h5>

<p>The conception of the Erinnyes in this play is naturally
different from the Aeschylean and Sophoclean conceptions.
It is similar to but not identical with the picture of these
goddesses which we shall find in the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[122]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
It is, however, erroneous to suppose that the Furies who
in this play assail Orestes are conceived by the dramatist as
the subjective delusions of a madman. In our opinion, the
Erinnyes in Euripides, though not actually brought upon the
stage, are as real and as vital as the Erinnyes of Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
If the psychical effect which these goddesses produce upon
Orestes is greater in Euripides, this is because the Erinnyes
stand, so to speak, like vultures beside their prey, since the
Argives are about to condemn him to death, and because
Orestes is conceived as irremediably polluted, a victim
already ‘devoted’ to the Erinnyes. Hence, naturally, at
Argos Orestes feels that he is powerless to struggle against
the Erinnyes; his insight into the immediate future and
his contemplation of his approaching fate deprives him, temporarily,
of sanity and self-control. We must not suppose
that a more tender or more civilised and ‘modern’ Orestes
realises his guilt more keenly than does the archaic Orestes
of Aeschylus, nor must we imagine that this feeling of remorse
and self-contempt produces the mental insanity which creates
a more hideous Erinnys. On the contrary, Orestes is here,
as elsewhere, subjectively innocent. He admits no moral
guilt. If the legend insists that he is guilty, if the public
opinion of the Argives decides to punish him with death, he
does not admit the validity of this conception or of the decision,
but nevertheless his fear of the Erinnyes naturally increases,
since in death even more than in life can these titanic monsters
torture the slayer. Aeschylus makes them say<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>:</p>

<p>It is Orestes’ fear of such titanic monsters waiting to inflict

this Euripidean drama:</p>

<p class="noindent">The conflicting attitudes of the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra
and the Erinnyes of Agamemnon which we found in the
<i>Choephoroe</i> of Aeschylus are also revealed in this play.

<p class="noindent">We shall meet the Erinnyes of Clytaemnestra in a somewhat
similar rôle in the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>. But in that play
the Erinnyes are not united in their conception of Orestes as
they are here. Those Erinnyes who refuse to accept the
‘acquittal’ of Orestes by the Areopagus continue to pursue
him to the Tauric Chersonese. When Orestes sees them he
cries out<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, she will kill me! Whither shall I fly?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The important thing to remember about the Euripidean
Erinnyes is that they are real goddesses, not mental fictions.
The Furies of the ‘Argive Scene’ are the Furies who pursue
the criminal convicted of wilful matricide. For him there is no
cleansing. To him no land can offer the shelter of its protection.
‘Alone, he has arrayed against him the universe.’<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Sooner
or later he will be put to death and will be delivered into the
hands of the Erinnyes. But in the Attic legend Orestes is not a
wilful matricide. Hence the Erinnyes of the <i>Iphigenia</i> drama<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
are not so implacable as the Erinnyes of the <i>Orestes</i>. They
are placated by the simple device of transferring an image
of Artemis from the Tauric land to Athens!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Iphigenia in Aulide’ and ‘Iphigenia in Tauris’</span></h4>

<p>A comparison of these two dramas reveals at first sight
a rather obvious inconsistency. The Aulid play centres
round Agamemnon’s sacrificial slaying of his daughter at
Aulis, while in the Tauric play the victim reappears as a
priestess of Artemis amongst the Tauri! It is generally maintained
that the last scene of the Aulid play, which describes
the substitution of a stag for the maiden by a miraculous
intervention, is not the work of Euripides. But in the
<i>Orestes</i> Apollo intervenes to preserve the life of Helen,
though he can do so only by deifying her! In the Aulid
play, also, Iphigeneia is said to have been saved from death
by deification.<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In the Tauric drama, however, the daughter
of Agamemnon has once more assumed a mortal form and
appears as a priestess of Artemis among the Tauri. Nowhere
else in Euripides can we find such a magical atmosphere. If
the human Iphigeneia was really saved, would we not expect
that her father and her mother should have been informed
of her deliverance? But they both believe that she is dead.<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
The plea which Clytaemnestra advances in the <i>Electra</i> of
Euripides,<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> namely that the death of Agamemnon was a
revenge for the death of her daughter, is based upon the reality
of her death. Hence we think that Euripides reproduced
both these legends of Iphigeneia simply because of their human
interest and dramatic merit, without any special concern
for their consistency. It is clear that Euripides did not
invent the Aulid story, since it is found in Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and
in an epic poem,<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> entitled the <i>Cypria</i>, of post-Homeric
date. The Tauric story is not found in any previous author,
but we do not think that it was invented by Euripides. Both
legends suggest a similar source. Two hundred years before
Euripides<a id="FNanchor_1670b" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> it was said that Iphigeneia was made immortal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
by Artemis, who brought her from Aulis to the Tauri, and
substituted for her a stag-victim. As soon as Iphigeneia
became a goddess she could, like other goddesses, be easily
transferred from place to place by a simple transference of
images. Herodotus says<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> that the goddess to whom the
Tauri sacrificed was Iphigeneia the daughter of Agamemnon.
The word ‘Iphigeneia’ was apparently a cultus epithet of
Artemis<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> which signified her connexion with fertility and
her influence on the birth of men and animals. The real as
distinct from the legendary deification of Iphigeneia was
therefore due to the abstraction and personification of a cultus
epithet. The existence of a temple of Artemis-Iphigeneia at
Aulis, whence Agamemnon sailed to Troy, and the similarity
of the name Iphigeneia with Iphianassa (the Homeric name
for a daughter of Agamemnon), led to a belief in the deification
of Iphianassa at Aulis. Moreover, the survival at Halae, in
Attica, in historical times of a mock ritual of human sacrifice
to Artemis induced the further idea that Iphianassa had been
deified through sacrifice at Aulis. The existence at Halae of a
statue of Artemis believed to have been brought from
the Tauric land, and the existence there of a temple to ‘the
maiden’ at which real rites of human sacrifice were enacted,
explain the origin of the Tauric belief which is referred to by
Herodotus. Iphianassa, identified with Iphigeneia, becomes
a goddess among the Tauri, and Iphigeneia is worshipped as
the daughter of Agamemnon! The final transition to the
stage in which Iphigeneia returns to life as a priestess of
Artemis at Tauri is explained by reference to the ancient
tendency to identify the priest with the god and by the ritual
of resurrection or re-birth which is found in ancient fertility-religion.
England<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> thinks that this stage was probably
pre-Euripidean but that the story of Orestes’ visit to the Tauri
was invented by Euripides. We do not think that even this
story was of Euripidean origin. It belongs rather, we think,
to the legends of the wandering of Orestes, which conceived
him as guilty of extenuated or quasi-involuntary matricide
which was ultimately ‘forgiven.’ When Iphigeneia was
conceived as a priestess of Artemis and at the same time as
the sister of Orestes, the evolution of a story which described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
Orestes’ visit to the Tauri does not, we think, require the
genius of Euripides. Again, the inconsistencies of this story
with the Aulid story which he has dramatised, with arguments
which he introduces in the <i>Electra</i><a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and with other legends
of Orestes, such as the Arcadian legend, and, moreover, the
insult to Apollo, the degradation of Athene, and the exaltation
of Artemis which this story involves—all suggest a local origin
for the story and the inspiration of theocratic legend-makers
rather than the invention of a dramatist.</p>

<p>In the <i>Iphigenia in Aulide</i> the sacrifice of Iphigeneia is
condemned as murder not only by Clytaemnestra<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> but also
by Achilles,<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> whose promised marriage with Iphigeneia was
the bait by which legend lured her from her Argive home. This
view, we have said,<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> belongs to an age which has rejected
human sacrifice and which interprets all the traditional
systems of blood-vengeance as unrestricted hereditary vendetta.
It belongs therefore to the border-line between the Dark
Ages of Greece and the civilised historical era. From the legal
point of view Clytaemnestra’s plea has no validity; we see
in it rather a counterpart to the plea of justification which
Orestes based on the command of Apollo. If Orestes claims
the command of Apollo as a justification and if this claim is
disputed, then the command of Artemis to Agamemnon may
also be impugned. Artemis has the same right to obedience
as Apollo has. If the Furies of the dead Clytaemnestra
rejected the Apolline oracle, it was natural that the living
Clytaemnestra should have repudiated the justice of the
decree of Artemis at Aulis.</p>

<p>The <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> merits special consideration
from our present point of view. As the general <i>dénouement</i>
of the plot is sufficiently familiar, we shall proceed <i>in medias
res</i>. We may confine our comments to the speech delivered
by Orestes to Iphigeneia after their mutual recognition.
Omitting for the moment Orestes’ reference to the Athenian
custom of using separate drinking-cups on the Libation-day
of the Anthesteria festival, we will give first Orestes’ description
of his trial at Athens and of its immediate sequel. It will be
noted that he has already served a period of exile before he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
reaches Athens and that the verdict of the Areopagus is not
accepted by all the Erinnyes. We have suggested<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> that the
Erinnyes symbolise in this legend the attitude of the relatives
of the slain and that the Areopagus acts as a court of reconciliation
rather than as an ordinary homicide court. We have
seen that the relatives had always a theoretical right to refuse
to accept ‘appeasement’ in cases of involuntary homicide,
according to the Draconian law, ἁπάντας ἢ τὸν κωλύοντα
κρατεῖν: ‘let all be appeased or let one objector hold the
field.’<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> We cannot suppose that the Erinnyes of
Clytaemnestra in this play assume the same attitude to
Orestes as they assume in the <i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus,
for in Aeschylus the conversion of the Erinnyes signifies
acceptance of the plea of justifiable matricide. Neither is
their attitude to be compared to that of the Erinnyes
of the Argive scene in the <i>Orestes</i>, for there they conceive
Orestes as guilty of wilful matricide. Their attitude here is
rather that of the ‘second Attic legend,’ in which Orestes
is conceived as a matricide of partial guilt—his crime being
conceived as extenuated by Apollo’s command. According
to this assumption we can explain the conflict of opinion
which characterises the Erinnyes. It is derived from a
legendary conception of the Erinnyes as the symbols of the
relatives of the slain Clytaemnestra who are presumed
to have refused ‘appeasement’ and to have resisted the
verdict of the Areopagus, which was conceived as a court
of reconciliation rather than as a high State court adjudicating
with full authority on questions of guilt or innocence.
Orestes says:</p>

<p class="noindent">But Orestes’ visit to Delphi merely suspends, it does not
terminate, the pursuit of the Erinnyes. At this point the
religious rather than the legal aspect of the Erinnyes comes
into prominence, and what may be described as a magical
mode of appeasement is indicated by Apollo when he commands
Orestes to visit the temple of Artemis among the Tauri,
to bring back with him the image of the Tauric Artemis and
to deposit it in an Attic temple. Orestes says to Iphigeneia:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here we breathe the atmosphere of religious expiation rather
than of legal atonement. The origin of this oracular command
may be attributed to Attic priests of Artemis, for in
the temple at Halae there was an image which was believed
to have been brought from the Tauri.<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> This expiation was
not in any real sense ‘purgation,’ but it was sufficiently similar
in character to be readily confused with it.<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> We are
reminded of the expiatory sacrifice offered at the altar of the
Erinnyes or the Semnai Theai at the Areopagus by persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
who had been acquitted of homicide at the Areopagus court
and by involuntary slayers who had returned from exile.<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
We may recall also the expiatory festival which Medea instituted
at Corinth after she had slain her children and put
to death the King of Corinth and his daughter.<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In this
play a mock ceremonial of purgation is performed in connexion
with Orestes by Iphigeneia. She says<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>:</p>

<p class="noindent">It will seem curious that Thoas, a barbarian king, should

<h5><span class="smcap">Orestes and the Pitcher Feast</span></h5>

<p>The suggestion of Orestes that his ‘pollution,’ when he
reached the Attic land, was the origin of the Attic rite which
prescribed the use of separate cups on the second day of the
Anthesteria is of interest as an illustration of what is known
as the aetiological myth. Orestes says to Iphigeneia<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Is by that people held in honour high.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Euripides is not our only authority for such a myth. Its
existence is confirmed by Athenaeus<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and by Suidas.<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
It is not probable that Euripides himself invented it. At
the Libation-feast which was known as the ‘Cups’ (χόες)
an unusual custom decreed that each man should drink from
a separate goblet and forbade any suggestion of collective
drinking such as attached to the ordinary wine-bowl. The
Athenians did not understand the real origin of this rite. In
the strange blending of joy and sorrow which characterised
this Dionysiac festival, they overlooked the connexion which
existed between the public civic offering, at this festival, of
libations to dead ancestors of the citizens as a whole and
the primitive tomb-offerings (χοαί) of tribal ancestor-worship.
Coulanges has indicated<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the private, individual, or domestic
nature of such tomb-offerings. He goes so far as to suggest
that the origin of private ownership in land is to be attributed
to the exclusive and non-communistic character of primitive
ancestor-worship. Even in Solon’s time the laws defined
rigidly the limit of relationship to the deceased which permitted
a relative’s presence at the funeral.<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The worship
of Dionysus had many affinities with the worship of the dead.
It is in such affinities that we must seek, in the last resort,
the explanation of the gloom and morbid mourning which
permeates all Greek tragedy. But we cannot suppose
that the Dionysiac festival was able to import an aspect of
civic communism into the essentially local and tribal ritual
of tomb-libations. Hence, we believe a compromise was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
accepted in which men were permitted to drink together at
a public libation-festival but were compelled to drink from
separate vessels and to sit at separate tables! Such, we
believe, was the real origin of this strange rite. But the
Athenians, who were ignorant of its true origin, sought to
find for it at least an intelligible explanation. They knew
from the Attic legends of Orestes that this Argive prince
had come to Athens for his trial. They knew that a kin-slayer
who had not yet been tried and declared innocent
was ‘polluted’ with a minor kind<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> of pollution wherever
he went. His purgation by Apollo was legally valid for
Phocis if an Apolline court had declared him innocent.
But in the Attic legends he was untried and therefore unpurged.
They argued therefore that when Orestes came to
Athens to submit to trial on a charge of kin-slaying, he was
prohibited from public civic and religious communion with
Athenian citizens. It does not matter in this connexion
whether the plea of Orestes was justifiable matricide or extenuated
matricide. As he had been proclaimed as an unjust
slayer by the avengers, who in this case were the Erinnyes,
he was ‘polluted’ until he had either established his innocence
or indicated the completion of his atonement to a court of
reconciliation. Now ‘pollution’ was regarded by the ancients
as a disease of a quasi-physical nature. Murder courts had
to be held, even by night, in the open air. The ‘polluted’
man could not enter the temples or the market-place. He
could not eat at anyone’s table. He was isolated from public
life. His civic existence was suspended. If, then, it be
supposed that Orestes arrived for his trial at Athens during
the Anthesteria festival, he could not have been received
into civic or religious communion. Hence the creators
of this myth could quite naturally have conceived that a
compromise was agreed upon by which the Athenians preserved,
on the one hand, their reputation for hospitality,
and respected, on the other, the religion of pollution. They
admitted Orestes to the public feast, but they insisted that
he should sit apart and drink from a separate vessel! It was
thus that the Athenians explained the origin of this rite: nor
is the explanation to be regarded as ‘anomalous’ or ‘artificial,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
as Miss Harrison suggests.<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> To people who were ignorant
of the real origin of the Pitcher Feast, this was at least a
respectable and intelligible aetiology.</p>

<p>Orestes says to Iphigeneia that he had some difficulty in
refraining from rebuking his hosts on this occasion.<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Miss
Harrison’s explanation<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> of this statement is that Orestes
was mad! But we are convinced that Orestes was not mad,
either at Athens or amongst the Tauri, though he may have
been temporarily insane amongst the Argives.<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that there were conflicting opinions concerning
the guilt of Orestes in different legends. The predominant
opinion in Aeschylus and in the legend (probably
Phocian) which referred to his purgation by Apollo suggests
that his act was justified. The Argive legend which we have
met in the <i>Orestes</i> of Euripides conceived his act as wilful
matricide which involved an eternal pollution. But the
prevailing conception of Orestes’ act which we find in the
legends of post-Homeric times regards him as guilty of matricide
extenuated through Apollo’s command. The dramatic
attempt to unify these various legends is the source of the
complexity of the problem of Oresteian blood-vengeance
in Euripides. It is impossible to analyse successfully the
legal and religious position of a hero who is tried and who is
at the same time untried, who is eternally and who is at the
same time temporarily polluted, in one and the same drama!
But the myth of the Pitcher Feast was based on a well-defined
tradition. It ignored the Argive and the Phocian legends,
it ignored also what we have called the first Attic legend, and
it considered only the second Attic legend from which the
<i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> drama was ultimately derived.</p>

<p>The surprise which Orestes feels at the partial social boycott
which confronts him in Athens is, we think, to be attributed
to the coexistence of the Attic and the Phocian legends. In
the Phocian legend Orestes was tried and purged, therefore
he could visit any Greek city with impunity. But the Attic
legend suggested that this purgation, though valid for Phocis,
could not be accepted by the Athenians, so long as the
avenging Erinnyes pursued, until Orestes had been acquitted
by an Athenian court. This conflict of legendary view-points<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
explains, we believe, the divergence of opinions which is
suggested by these words.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Phoenician Maidens’ and the ‘Suppliants’</span></h4>

<p>The homicide-problems of the <i>Phoenissae</i> and of the <i>Supplices</i>
may be simultaneously discussed, as both these dramas
are concerned with the war of the Seven against Thebes. The
dramas correspond in their general atmosphere and in regard
to the problems which they present with the <i>Septem</i> of
Aeschylus or the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles. We also find
an incidental reference<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> to the punishment of Oedipus
which recalls the <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> and the <i>King Oedipus</i>
of Sophocles. Euripides, in his account of the conflict which
took place between Polyneices and Eteocles and of the war
between the Argives and the Thebans is, from a legal point of
view, more satisfactory than his brother dramatists, inasmuch
as he makes a clear distinction between the different aspects
of the problem of burial in both cases. Polyneices may or
may not have been a fratricide and a traitor,<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> but the Argives
at least were legitimate belligerents. In the <i>Antigone</i> these
two issues seem to have been deliberately confused. The
burial of the Argives was a question for Greek international
law, the violation of which brought down upon the offenders
the anger of the gods. The burial of Polyneices was a more
delicate question, upon which the gods might adopt divergent
attitudes. Teiresias, in the <i>Antigone</i>, does not differentiate
very clearly between the religious aspects of these two problems.
The gods were angry—about that there was no doubt. But
might not this anger have been mainly, if not entirely, due to
the non-burial of the Argives? Here are the words addressed
by Teiresias to Kreon<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Are forming leagues in troublous enmity.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, Euripides, on the other hand, keeps these two
questions clearly distinct. The burial of the Argives, being
an international question, is referred by Adrastus to Theseus,<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
King of Athens. At first Theseus refuses to intervene, and
rightly, since Athens was merely one of a number of Greek
States, and she did not wish to undertake single-handed a war
which was properly an Amphictyonic war. But ultimately
Theseus, yielding to the persuasion of his mother and of
Adrastus, fought and defeated the Theban army under
the command of Kreon, and handed over the bodies of the
Argives to their relatives for burial.<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> That in refusing burial
to the Argives Kreon had violated a Greek international law
is clear from many passages in the <i>Suppliants</i>. Thus Aethra
says<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The problem of the burial of Polyneices has two distinct
aspects in Euripides, as it has in Sophocles. In both accounts
Polyneices was ultimately buried, as it was necessary for
legend to insist that he should be, in view of the existence of
tombs in Thebes which were said to contain the bones of all
the seven Argive leaders.<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But whereas in Sophocles it is
religious fear which causes Kreon to consent to the burial of
Polyneices, in Euripides we feel that it is rather the victorious
intervention of Theseus which is the cause of this <i>dénouement</i>.
Eteocles and Polyneices are represented by Euripides as having
foreseen the conflict which would rage over their burial when
they had mutually slain each other. Thus, Eteocles solemnly
binds Kreon to refuse burial to Polyneices<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">But I, on the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thee, O Kreon, this injunction lay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I prove stronger, suffer not the corse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Polyneices in this Theban realm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be interred: let death be the reward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of him who scatters dust o’er his remains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although he be the dearest of my friends.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, Polyneices is said to have commanded, as he lay dying,
his mother and Antigone to bury him in Theban soil<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But bury me, O thou who gav’st me birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my loved sister, in my native land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your mediation to appease the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uniting, that of my paternal soil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough for a poor grave I may obtain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though I have lost the empire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus Euripides conceives in a twofold aspect the act of
Polyneices. Subjectively, he thinks, Polyneices was justified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
in attacking and in slaying his brother<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>: objectively,
however, or technically, he was a traitor and a fratricide
because <i>prima facie</i> he was the aggressor.<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> But the sympathetic
intuition of Antigone looks beyond the superficial
enactments of a political justice of which the obscure and
oscillating dictates cannot compete with her love for her
brother in life, with her grief for him in death, and with her
reverence for the solemn injunction which his dying lips had
uttered.</p>

<p>The punishment of Oedipus which is mentioned in the
<i>Phoenissae</i> is based, we believe, on the conception of his
fatal act as voluntary homicide,<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> but it also takes into
account the facts of the Homeric narrative. The Homeric<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
story of the continued rule of Oedipus ‘over the Cadmeans’
was not in harmony with Achaean principles of blood-vengeance.
Homer does not understand it. Perhaps this is because,
in Boeotia, as Leaf points out,<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> the Achaeans had not established
their power. It is possible that Oedipus enjoyed
immunity from punishment because of his position as a Minoan
autocrat, but as there existed in legendary story many capable
and willing avengers it is better to attribute his immunity
to a discrimination between degrees in homicide-guilt which we
have associated with Pelasgian tribal custom, and to interpret
the Homeric reference as a Pelasgian ‘reminiscence.’<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>In Homer, Oedipus lives, dies, and is buried in Thebes.
But post-Homeric legend, under the influence of the pollution
doctrine, could not accept these facts. Even if the plea of
quasi-involuntary homicide which Oedipus himself put forward
had been accepted he would still have had to go into exile
for at least a period of years, and even then he could not have
returned to his domestic religion or have been buried in the
tomb of his fathers. The duration of exile for extenuated
or involuntary slaying in historical times, and therefore
presumably<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> in the pollution era, depended on the will of
the relatives of the slain. One single objector could have
extended the exile period indefinitely, at least in theory,
according to the law ‘let all consent to be appeased or let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
one objector hold the field.’<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But in the post-Homeric
story of Oedipus, as Sophocles gives it, the plea of Oedipus
was not accepted. He was regarded as a voluntary homicide
and sent into exile. It is true that when Polyneices himself
was banished, for political reasons, from Thebes, he naturally
relented, and in his altered mood he offered to restore Oedipus
to his home.<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But in order to restore Oedipus it was necessary
that Kreon and Eteocles should be either killed or exiled, and
this contingency had not been realised. In Euripides the
unhappy king ultimately suffers the same fate. Kreon says
to Oedipus<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But to my words, O Oedipus, attend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eteocles, thy son, hath to these hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consigned the sceptre of the Theban realm, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I for this cause no longer can allow thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here to reside: for in the clearest terms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teiresias has pronounced that, while thou dwell’st</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In these domains, Thebes never can be blest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore depart. Nor through a wanton pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor any hate I bear thee, do I hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such language, but because I justly dread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy evil genius will destroy this land.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Oedipus refers to the Apolline oracle which foretold
that he would die in Athens (an oracle which Sophocles also
mentions<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>) when he says<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The oracle of Phoebus is fulfilled ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in Athens an exile I shall die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in Euripides it is clear that Oedipus is not banished before
the death of Eteocles and Polyneices. A number of years is
known to have elapsed during which he still lived in Thebes.
But he was imprisoned all the time, and, as this suggestion
is not implied in the Homeric story, we must suppose that some
legend invented this novel device by which part at least of
the Homeric facts could be brought into harmony with the
requirements of the post-Homeric doctrine of ‘pollution.’
It supposed that Oedipus continued to live in Thebes, not
however as a king or as a free citizen with full civic rights,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
but as an imprisoned criminal who by the very fact of his
imprisonment did not pollute the State. Jocasta, who, in
accordance with the Homeric narrative, is represented as
living in Thebes for many years after the crimes<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> of Oedipus
were committed, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Soon as he learned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I whom he had wedded was his mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The miserable Oedipus, o’erwhelmed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With woes accumulated, from their sockets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tore with a golden clasp his bleeding eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But since the beard o’ershaded my sons’ cheeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their sire they in a dungeon have confined,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The memory of this sad event t’ efface,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For which they needed every subtle art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within those mansions he still lives, but sick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With evil fortunes, on his sons pours forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The most unholy curses, that this house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They by the sword may portion out.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have said<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> that ‘pollution’ was conceived by the
Greeks as a quasi-physical reality which resembled a contagious
disease. In historical times a ‘polluted’ murderer
was isolated by imprisonment. A law of Dracon, which is
confirmed by Plato and by Demosthenes, prescribed that a
convicted murderer <i>en rupture de ban</i> could be arrested and
imprisoned, instead of being put to death, by the first person
who encountered him.<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> But imprisonment was never
regarded, in Attic law, as a permanent method of isolation
for a murderer, simply because it was not a recognised legal
penalty for homicide. Oedipus therefore would have been
justified, from the standpoint of historical law, in uttering
curses against his relatives who imprisoned him. Hence we
suggest that this story of the imprisonment of Oedipus was
invented by some legend-maker of the pre-Draconian age, in
an attempt to harmonise the Homeric story of the continued
life of Oedipus at Thebes with the post-Homeric atmosphere
which regarded him as ‘polluted’ and debarred from civil
and religious communion with his fellow-citizens. Euripides
implies<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> that ultimately the Apolline oracle was fulfilled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
and that Oedipus died as an exile at Athens. In view of
the general acceptance of this oracle by traditional legends
and of the ‘established fact’<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> of the burial of Oedipus at
Athens, Euripides appears to have abandoned the Homeric
account of the burial of Oedipus at Thebes. In this he reveals
more intelligence and a greater insight into the meaning
of the post-Homeric legend than did Pausanias and his
authorities who believed that the bones of Oedipus were
transferred from Thebes to Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> For either Oedipus was
‘polluted’ or he was not. If he was, he could not have been
buried at Thebes, since he was regarded as a wilful murderer:
if he was not, then he need not have come to Athens as a
homicide-exile at all.</p>

<p>The statement of Jocasta<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> that Oedipus was imprisoned
in order that his disgrace might be forgotten, and that of
Kreon<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> that Oedipus had to be exiled for ever because he
was ‘polluted,’ are inconsistent; but we may infer from
these statements, which Euripides himself composed, that he
did not quite understand the origin and motive of the story
of the imprisonment of Oedipus. For whoever invented this
story did so with a definite purpose, namely, to reconcile
religious doctrine with historical fact. The inventor knew
the meaning and purpose of his invention. Hence the statement
of Jocasta to which we have referred cannot have
originated with the inventor of the story, for otherwise she
would have said that Oedipus was imprisoned to avoid
pollution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we think that here again Euripides sought to
achieve dramatic interest by introducing an antique variant
of the story which Sophocles had ignored. In Sophocles,
Oedipus dies before the clash of arms takes place between
the Argives and the Thebans. In Euripides he lives to see
the realisation of his own curses, and becomes more easily
reconciled to his own sad fate when he finds that Destiny
has avenged him in his turn, as Laius was avenged, and that
in leaving Thebes he has removed from his life the local anger
of ghosts and gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Mad Hercules’</span></h4>

<p>The theme of this drama is one of the multitudinous
episodes which are associated with the life of Hercules. Now
the legends of Hercules have this much in common with such
legends as we have examined concerning Orestes and Oedipus,
that they refer to the deeds of a great man who has died.
In Greek religion, apart from the Olympian Pantheon of
the Achaean caste, every great man assumed a divine nature
when he died. But the Olympian religion did not recognise
the right of man to become divine, and therefore whenever
legend attributes human acts to such Olympian gods as Apollo
or Athene (of whose mortal life there was no record) we must
assume that at the time of such acts these gods have temporarily
assumed a human form. But Hercules never was
an Olympian. In Homer, Hercules is mentioned in a manner
which suggests that he had been living quite recently upon
this earth, and living moreover a normal human life. We
find him in Hades, like all other dead men, though, curiously,
he retains some of his old vitality, for he is married to Hebe,
the goddess of eternal youth.<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> We hear of his maternal
uncles living ordinary human lives in Argos or in Thebes,<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
and his grandsons actually fought in the Trojan war! We will
not here attempt to discuss the origin of the Grecian cult of
Hercules. Müller, of course, connects him with the Dorians.
He thinks that Hercules and Apollo, in their respective rôles
of hero and of god, satisfied the normal wants of Dorian
religiousness.<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We admit that the exaltation of Hercules
as a divinity was of post-Homeric origin; but it is futile, we
believe, to seek to distinguish the historical from the fictitious
strata in Heraclean legends. At the dawn of European
literature the human life of Hercules, if there ever was such
a man, was a thing of the past, and it is therefore more than
probable that all the post-Homeric legends of Hercules are
equally fictitious. The main point which we wish to emphasise
here is that most of the legends of Hercules are based
on the assumption that he had not yet died: that he was a
mortal man, who obeyed, on most occasions, the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
social humanity, not a god who had condescended to take
human form and who was superior to the operation of natural
laws. We agree that in the legends of Hercules there is a
certain element of magic, such as is found in the legends of
Medea, or Jason, or Iphigeneia. This element imports into
Heraclean legends a certain degree of lawlessness or of chaos.
But, so far as homicide at least is concerned, we will assume
that Hercules is a man; not indeed an ordinary man, subject
to every ordinary law, but nevertheless a man, whose actions,
however archaically they may be conceived, can nevertheless
be explained. The difficulties which are presented by the
Heraclean legends are due in part to their archaic setting,
but still more to their almost infinite variety—a variety
which we may attribute to the multitude of localities in which
this Hero-god was worshipped. The greater the number
of shrines which a god or hero possessed, the greater was the
variety of the myths which grew up around him, because
ancient myths—which are not like modern fairy tales, but
which were rather sacred commemorations of religious events—could
be transferred from one Hero to another. Herodotus
tells<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> how Cleisthenes of Sicyon transferred the ‘tragic
choruses’ which commemorated the sorrows of Adrastus
to the cult of Dionysus. Thus too must Hercules have had
attributed to him the joyful exploits as well as the sorrowful
events of the ‘lives’ of local Heroes. For this reason, and
because of the tendency of myths to become more and more
fanciful, we believe that the legends of Hercules as of most
gods are ‘fictitious.’</p>

<p>In the Euripidean drama, the <i>Mad Hercules</i>, we are
told that Hercules, in a fit of madness, slew his wife, Megara,
and his children.<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> He was deluded by the goddess Hera<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
into believing that he was thereby inflicting death upon the
children of his taskmaster, Eurystheus. We may recall a
somewhat similar delusion which was sent in a Sophoclean
drama by Athene upon Ajax. But whereas in the <i>Ajax</i> no
actual homicide occurs, here we have actual bloodshed, and,
worst of all, kin-slaying. From a legal point of view, the
position of Hercules is therefore quite different from that
of Ajax. It is, we think, more akin to that of Oedipus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
Hercules slays his children without knowing that they are his
children. We may omit, for purposes of legal analysis, the
death of Megara, his wife, for this death is obscured by the
more heinous slaying of his kindred. Like Oedipus, Hercules
discovers the truth; like Ajax, he contemplates suicide.
He gives expression to sentiments regarding the punishment
of kin-slaying which are suggestive of historical Attic law;
though he forgets, for the moment, that his act was involuntary,
when he says<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Which waits me, shall I rush into the flames?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Presently he begins to feel that he should not be considered
fully culpable<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>; yet he sees that it will be difficult for him
to establish ‘extenuation’ as a plea.<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The fit of madness
which Hera had sent upon him was indeed a grim reality, but
it would be difficult to prove it in a court of justice. Moreover,
in the Euripidean account Hercules is an alien in Thebes.
His native State is Argos.<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> We have said that exile
was not permitted as a penalty for voluntary kin-slaying in
historical Greece. We have quoted<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Plato for the law that
even involuntary slaying between aliens was punished by
perpetual exile. If Hercules was an alien at Thebes, so also
were his children. In Homer<a id="FNanchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Thebes is the birthplace of
Hercules, but this Homeric fact is not accepted by Euripides.
In the following passage Hercules regards exile rather than
death as his correct and proper punishment, but owing to
the difficulty of proving involuntariness he fears that no city
will receive him. Thebes, he says, he must leave. To Argos,
his native home, he cannot return, because, as he says,<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> he
has been already banished from that State owing to his feud
with Eurystheus. In other places he will indeed be called a
kin-slayer, and if he cannot prove his innocence he may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
banished. This statement lends support to our theory that
in historical Greece exile was not permitted for voluntary
kin-slaying.<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> He says<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Shall not th’accursed miscreant be expelled?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the archaic atmosphere of the ‘life’ of Hercules furnishes
a solution for this problem. Theseus arrives from Athens!
Apparently we are now living in the days which preceded the
institution of citizen juries or even of Ephetae courts! As
Theseus, the autocratic King-judge, tried Oedipus at the
shrine of the Semnai,<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> so also, in a similarly informal manner,
he tries Hercules. He knows already, without being told of it,
that Hera is to blame. Therefore, he says<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">... This mischief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Springs from no god except the wife of Jove....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Hence he says to Hercules<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">From Thebes retire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since thus the laws ordain: and follow me</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A palace, and with thee divide my wealth.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What, we may ask, is the law to which Theseus here refers?
Wilamowitz<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> rightly says that the law is that which prohibits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
his continuance at Thebes. We believe, however,
that this was not a specifically Theban law. If it had been,
the fact would have been more clearly indicated. The law
in question is, we believe, an international law, which declared
that when an alien slew an alien, even without intent, he
must be debarred for ever from the State in which the deed
occurred. This law we have already quoted from Plato.<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Hercules therefore left Thebes and went to Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and
we are told that when, in course of time, he dies in Athens he
will receive the worship of a Hero!<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The similarity of
this <i>dénouement</i> to that of the <i>Oedipus Coloneus</i> of Sophocles
needs no comment. Both these consummations are based,
perhaps, on the existence of Hero-shrines in Attic soil. But
the legend-makers were careful not to give us legal impossibilities.
Hercules had shrines everywhere in Greece. Yet
Hercules could not go to Argos, for the simple reason that he
had been exiled from that city. He could not return to
Thebes because of ‘the law.’ It was fortunate then for
Hercules that he found a king such as Theseus who admitted
without question the element of extenuation in his act.
In historical Greece a wilful kin-slayer could not have been
accepted as an exile in any State. The law which is referred
to by Theseus cannot therefore have reference to wilful slaying,
for it permitted him to leave Thebes. If he had slain his
children wilfully, it would not have allowed him the option
of exile. If he is allowed this option, it is because his deed
was viewed, either by the dramatist or by the legend-maker,
or by both, as extenuated or quasi-involuntary kin-slaying.
Such slaying in Greek law prescribed a period of exile,
temporary or perpetual, pending the appeasement of the
kinsmen.</p>

<p>Owing to the important differences which exist between
the Euripidean conception of the native state of Hercules
and Homer’s conception, we must assume that Euripides has
abandoned Homer and is following an Argive legend concerning
Hercules. This conclusion is strengthened by the
account which Euripides gives, in this play, of Amphitryon,
the father of Hercules. Euripides makes Amphitryon say<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[219]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
that he is an exile from Argos living at Thebes, because he
had slain Electryon. Now, if Euripides conceived Amphitryon
as a Theban by birth, he could not legally have
presented him, since he was a man-slayer, as a resident in
Thebes. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> that homicide-exiles were debarred
from three possible places of residence, namely (1) the State
of the slayer, (2) the State of the victim, and (3) the State in
which the deed of blood took place.</p>

<p>Pausanias also refers<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> to this legend of Amphitryon.
The Thebans of his time pointed out a ruined house in Thebes,
‘where they say Amphitryon dwelt when he fled from Tiryns
owing to the death of Electryon.’ As Tiryns was a city within
the boundary of the historical Argive State it is frequently
confused with Argos in the legends. Electryon was the father-in-law
and the uncle of Amphitryon. That the slaying of
Electryon was not wilful is suggested by certain facts. Thus,
the return of Amphitryon to Argos is said to depend on the
will of Eurystheus and the labours of Hercules are regarded
as the necessary ‘appeasement.’<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> We need not suppose
that there is any reference to the Pelasgian wergeld system
in the story of the ‘recompense’ which was demanded by
Eurystheus. This ‘recompense’ is more akin to the ‘appeasement’
of relatives in the pollution system. It was the father
of Eurystheus, Sthenelus, the brother of Electryon, who had
driven Amphitryon into banishment. Euripides concedes
this much to the claim of Thebes to be regarded as the home
of Amphitryon, in so far as he makes Amphitryon say<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
that he has settled there as an exile. But legally he could
not have lived there as a homicide-exile if he had been a
citizen of Thebes. Hence Euripides calls him ‘the Argive
Amphitryon.’ His hopes of an ultimate return to Argos
and of the ‘appeasement’ of Eurystheus suggest that his act
was involuntary, or quasi-involuntary. The very fact of
his exile points to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The attempt of Lycus, King of Thebes, to murder
Amphitryon, Megara, and the children of Hercules, is also
described in the play. The motive of Lycus was political.
Hercules had married Megara, daughter of Kreon, the Regent of
Thebes, and his family was therefore a dangerous rival in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
matter of dynastic succession. Hercules, as soon as he heard
of the plot, put Lycus to death.<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> This penalty, we have
suggested,<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> was a normal penalty for attempted murder
(βούλευσις) in Achaean or quasi-Achaean<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> society. We
have discussed this penalty in our analysis of the <i>Ajax</i> of
Sophocles. Whether there was an antique legend which
referred to this penalty, or whether the dramatist is consciously
archaising, it is difficult to decide. The Chorus, at least, have
no doubt that the penalty was just and Amphitryon takes the
same view.<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The Chorus say to him as he dies<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Others have perished by that bloody hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... the retribution thou endur’st ... is just.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Children of Hercules’</span></h4>

<p>Of the Heracleidae, another family of Hercules, Pausanias
says<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>: ‘When Hercules fled from Eurystheus at Tiryns,
he went to his friend Ceyx, the King of Trachis. But when
Hercules left the society of men<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Eurystheus demanded his
children, and Ceyx sent them to Athens, suggesting that
Theseus should protect them. And coming to Athens, they
caused the first war between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians,
as Theseus would not give them up to Eurystheus.’</p>

<p>In this Euripidean play, also, the children of Hercules are
represented as dwelling in the city of Athens, in the charge
of Iolaus and Alcmene,<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and the war between Eurystheus
and Theseus for their extradition is the main theme. The
presence of Iolaus in the drama is probably, we think, derived
from the legend of an expedition which the Athenians made
under his leadership to Sardinia.<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The chief point which
we wish to emphasise here is that the demand for the extradition
of the Heracleidae has no connexion with homicide.
Amphitryon had slain Electryon. Hercules had sought in
vain to ‘appease’ Eurystheus. It is now evident that
Eurystheus has refused all ‘appeasement,’ as the sons of
Oedipus refused it, <i>for political reasons</i>. In Greek law homicide
could not continue to afflict the children of a slayer unto the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
fourth generation. With the death of Amphitryon, the
homicide episode is closed. In this drama, the extradition
demand is therefore entirely political. Upon this point our
play is quite explicit. Eurystheus says to Alcmene<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>

<p class="noindent">Demophon, son of Theseus, refuses to give up the sons of
Hercules and uses as a pretext the right of suppliants.<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
We recall the statement of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> that Demophon
was the first Athenian who was tried at the Palladium court—a
court which regularly tried cases of homicide between
strangers.<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The words which Demophon speaks to the herald

<p class="noindent">imply that the right of suppliant was not potent to protect
offenders but was only potent to secure for them a respite
from merited punishment; moreover they imply that Eurystheus
has no right to demand the extradition of offenders
without the option of a trial.<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> We have already admitted
that the right of sanctuary helped to determine the locality
of certain courts, but we have maintained<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> that it had no
essential connexion with the origin of the principle of trials
for homicide, and that its connexion with murder courts is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
quite accidental. We have suggested that<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> in historical
Greece trial was a possible option for extradition in case
of homicide. Hence the refusal of Eurystheus to accept
trial suggests what Demophon definitely asserts,<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> that the
‘offence’ of the Heracleidae was not criminal but political.</p>

<p>But if the Heracleidae are innocent, what shall we say
of Eurystheus? Is he not as culpable as Lycus is in the
<i>Mad Hercules</i>? Is he not guilty of plotting murder for
political ends? If he is not yet αἴτιος φόνου, is he not guilty
of βούλευσις? For this crime, we have said, in early Greece,
the penalty was probably death.<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It is, then, significant
that in this play Eurystheus is put to death by the servants
of Alcmene.<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Both the penalty and its mode of execution
are archaic. Either legend retained these elements unadulterated
in their transition down the ages, or Euripides
deliberately imported into the myth an archaic atmosphere.
In neither case is Euripides giving us the ideas of his own
time, for in historical Greece βούλευσις was not punishable
by death.</p>

<p>Eurystheus was captured alive in the battle and hence
he claims the right of a captive warrior and demands the
protection of the Athenians!<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Alcmene, however, insists
that he should be given up to her for execution!<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> What a
nice legal problem was this for a litigious Athenian audience!
How replete it is with that intense human interest which was
so dear to Euripides! The conflict is skilfully depicted in
the dialogue which takes place between Alcmene and the
messenger (or the Chorus?) after the battle.<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Eurystheus’
appeal to the ‘laws of Greece’<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> implies the existence of
international legislation concerning the rights of war-captives,
but he himself had previously shown very little regard for
the international status of exiles. In vain does he advance
the plea of self-defence against these harmless but dangerous
children! The Athenians decide to take no action. They
cannot put to death a captive taken in war. But Alcmene
claims that Eurystheus is a murderer. According to ancient
practice, it is her privilege to avenge! Moreover, so far as
Alcmene is concerned, she will not bury a man whom she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
believes to be a criminal.<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> But unfortunately there was
an oracle of Apollo that Eurystheus should be buried in
Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The Athenians therefore are disposed to bury
him.<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> At first Alcmene says<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> that she will not object to
the burial of Eurystheus by the Athenians, but this assertion
is incompatible with the command which she gives to her
attendants later, to deliver the dead Eurystheus to the dogs.
We may perhaps assume that she performed a mock ritual of
‘exposure’ of the dead, that she cast the body of Eurystheus
beyond the boundaries, and that afterwards his relatives
removed him for sepulture. Such is the attempt which
Euripides seems to make to solve the deadlock between two
elements of Greek law, namely that which permitted the burial
of an enemy,<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and that which forbade the burial of a
murderer.<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In the archaic atmosphere of the play, homicide
and attempted homicide<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> are equated as identical. In the
words of Eurystheus, who declares in vain that his death
will cause pollution to his slayer, we discern at once the failure
of Euripides to be consistently archaic and the failure of a
dead man’s ghost to impose ‘pollution’ in the teeth of civic
law and international religion.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Medea’</span></h4>

<p>In regard to the origin and the evolution of the story of
Medea which is the subject of this drama, we cannot do better
than summarise the account which Verrall gives in his edition
of the play. Verrall thinks<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> that Medea was a Phoenician
moon-goddess who was worshipped at Corinth at an early
period, and to whom were offered, in sacrifice, human victims,
including children; that these rites, which in course of time
assumed a more civilised form, (when a mock ritual of human
sacrifice was accepted in the place of ancient realities,) were
‘transferred’ to the goddess Hera; that sacred legend retained
indeed a memory of Medea, but the evolution of Corinthian
religion degraded to the level of a priestess the Medea who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
once had been a goddess; and that hence arose the fiction
that Medea had once slain children—in sacrifice! Later,
Verrall thinks, this Corinthian story was expanded under the
influence of eastern Greek colonisation, and legend traced
in the route from the Euxine to Iolcos the natural course of
Medea’s introduction to Greek lands. Weird Asiatic notions
of sorcery and witchcraft clustered round her name; to her
were attributed the atrocities which legend-memory recorded
of the Aeolidae at Iolcos. Thus was Medea degraded not
only from a goddess to a priestess, but also from a priestess
to a sorceress, and from a sorceress to the vilest murderess
whom Grecian legends knew.</p>

<p>If the creators of the story of Medea were ignorant of her
original character, so also naturally was Euripides. For him,
Medea is not a goddess who has assumed the form of a woman,
but a woman who has not yet put off this mortal coil, and
who as yet has done little to deserve that she should, after
death, attain to divinity! As a woman, she is, despite her
magic, subject to social laws. Her deeds of blood must be
regarded from a legal standpoint, whether that standpoint
is applicable to one era or to another. Let us consider how
the deeds of Medea were avenged.</p>

<p>First of all, she slew her brother, Apsyrtus, in Colchis,
to prevent his pursuit.<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> For this crime she paid no penalty,
if we except the exile which destiny had, in any event, decreed
for her. It was quite unnecessary for the legend-maker to
invent this additional atrocity of fratricide, for to Colchis Medea
was never to return! But as exile was an archaic Pelasgian
penalty for wilful kin-slaying, this conception bears an antique
stamp which is attributable either to the antiquity of the
story or to the archaising of later minds.</p>

<p>Again, Medea caused the daughters of Pelias to put to death
their aged father by deluding them into the belief that by
cutting him in pieces and boiling him with certain magic
potions, they would restore him to youth and vigour.<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
Here Medea acts as the ‘plotter and contriver’<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> of murder.
In primitive as in historical<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> times, such a deed was
regarded as equally culpable with that of an actual slayer—indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
in the special circumstances of the case she was the
real if not the actual murderer of Pelias, and the daughters
of Pelias were guilty, at most, of involuntary slaying. We
cannot of course attribute to Medea the guilt of kin-slaying,
as she was not akin to Pelias. It is more probable that she
would have been regarded, for purposes of punishment, as
an ordinary murderess. In actual fact, she and Jason were
expelled from Thessaly. Even so, in the play,<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> she still fears
the vengeance of Acastus, the son of Pelias. This fact does
not imply that she was conceived as guilty of kin-slaying, which
in historical Greece was punishable by death. We believe
that the Thessalian story of Medea was not conceived from
the standpoint of historical law.</p>

<p>In this story there are complications of blood-vengeance
which suggest an Achaean, or rather what we may call a
quasi-Achaean atmosphere. While, in Homer,<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Pelias, son
of Poseidon, rules over Iolcos like an Achaean, by divine
right, later legend revealed that he had previously defrauded
his half-brother Aeson of the kingdom and put him to death,
and that Jason the son of Aeson had himself narrowly escaped
death at his hands. Hence it was natural that Jason, the one-sandalled
hero of the oracle,<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> should command Medea to put
Pelias to death. That is the real reason why Jason, together
with Medea, was banished from Thessaly by Acastus. This
quasi-Achaean exile is therefore similar to the Achaean ‘flight
from death,’ and hence it is that Medea still fears the vengeance
of Acastus.<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> When Jason arrived at Corinth, he became
affianced to the king’s daughter, just as the Achaean Tydeus
became the son-in-law of Adrastus.<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> No pollution was
involved in an alliance with a kin-slayer! The presence of
such Achaean episodes in Euripides, side by side with
episodes which bear a later stamp, suggests either a marvellous
capacity for archaising on the part of the dramatist or,
more probably, the unadulterated transmission of an antique
legend.<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The main plot of this drama reveals two further atrocities
which were perpetrated by Medea. She plots the death of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
husband, of his intended wife, Glauce, of his intended father-in-law,
Kreon, King of Corinth, and of her own two children,
whom she had borne to Jason. Her murderous plot proved
successful, except in regard to Jason. Her children she
slew deliberately with her own hand. It happened, previously,
that Aegeus, King of Athens, arrived at Corinth. Medea,
well aware of the consequences of the murderous plot which
she had planned, and being, in addition, under an edict of
banishment from Corinth, entreated Aegeus to give her protection
at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> He promised to do so, but she was not
content with a promise. She bound Aegeus under a solemn
oath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Swear by the earth on which we tread, the sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy grandsire and by all the race of gods ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That from your land you never will expel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor while you live consent that any foe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall tear me thence.<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One or two problems are suggested by this quotation. If
Medea had not succeeded in securing this solemn contract
on the part of Aegeus, would she have carried out her plot?
And was Aegeus bound by the oath when he discovered the
sequel? In this section of the story—which is the main
theme of our play—homicide is conceived as a ‘pollution,’<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
and in the pollution system exile was not permitted for
voluntary kin-slaying.<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The murder of her children was
by far the most serious offence which Medea committed, since
they were her kindred. For the other deeds of blood she could
have legally sought asylum at Athens, as she was not a citizen
of that State, and the deeds had not been perpetrated there.
Medea seems to be well aware of these facts, for she utters no
hint to Aegeus of her dreadful plans. But it was her intention
of slaying her children which led her to extract from Aegeus
this solemn oath. If he had refused to swear, she would, we
believe, have slain all her intended victims, but she would then
have committed suicide.</p>

<p>But was the oath which Aegeus swore binding in Greek
international law? Apparently Medea thought so, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
Euripides seems to think so, too. The Chorus, however, do
not understand how Medea can find a refuge at Athens.
But it is only in the slaying of the children that they seem to
find a difficulty. They say<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent4">Think on this atrocious deed</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Ere the dagger aim the blow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But at the end of the play the Sun-god, the grandfather of
Medea, places his chariot at her disposal in order to facilitate
her journey to Athens,<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> the Corinthian gods accepting,
as an expiation, the establishment by blood-stained hands
of a festival and mystic rites!<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Jason is foredoomed to
death,<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and we are told that Medea will escape the Erinnyes
of her children!<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>If Euripides, as Wedd maintains,<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> habitually contrasts
the morality of the legends with that of his own day, we can
only say that here the contrast is so obvious that it need not
have been indicated at all. But is such a contrast really
indicated? Does the futile protest of the Chorus represent
the Athens of Euripides, and does the action of Aegeus typify
the Athens of a barbarous past? If not, how do we explain
the facts of the drama? In our view, it is Jason, not Medea,
who is the villain of this play. Medea had left her home,
her kindred, everything that life held dear, for the love of a
Greek adventurer. Jason never taunts Medea with the slaying
of his father. He had commanded it. Driven forth as an
exile from the land of Thessaly, she clings to her blood-stained
mate. In Corinth he deserts her, and she is ordered to go
away—anywhere, somewhere, into the great unknown. To
the distracted mind of a desperate woman who sees herself
deserted in a friendless world comes then the image of a two-edged
sword, begotten of slighted love and sexual jealousy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
Love rejected, love transferred, transforms Medea from a
faithful friend into a dangerous enemy. Her children, erstwhile
the sweetest pledges of affection, are now so many goads
which stimulate her vengeance. The conflict of passions
which rages in Medea’s breast is depicted by Euripides with
matchless skill. It proclaims her at once human and insane.
Subjectively therefore she need only plead guilty to extenuated
homicide, to slaying in a passion; and if such a plea were
accepted she would be entitled in Greek law<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> to the sanctuary
of exile. Why then does she bind Aegeus by an oath? We
suggest that the explanation is to be found in the distinction
between the objective or legal aspect of an act and its subjective
or psychological aspect. It would have been difficult
for Medea to have established her plea in any court, formal
or informal. Aegeus might not have given her the benefit
of the doubt, as Theseus did to Oedipus, and Medea could take
no risks. Furthermore, this legend has an archaic setting, and
portrays a Greek story of a period which was antecedent to the
establishment of regular State courts of justice and to codified
international law. This explains why Aegeus observed his
oath. There was no authority of an international religion
to declare that it was not binding. Viewed in this light, the
protest of the Chorus in our last quotation is a confirmation
of our hypothesis. They actually approve of the slaying of
Kreon and of his daughter, though they regret that they should
have suffered for Jason’s infamy. They say<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven its collected store of evil seems</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This day resolved with justice to pour down</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To celebrate thy nuptial feast.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When the Chorus urge Medea not to slay her children, we feel
that they are prompted by feelings of pity and humanity,
rather than by any sense of legal or religious guilt. In the
following passage in which we see the strongest and most
emphatic instance of their disapproval of Medea’s act, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
main objection is that her act is unusual! Only one woman,
they say, has ever been known to do such a deed before!<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Art thou a rock, O wretch, or steel to slay</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, in this play we have no Euripidean contrast of barbarous
with civilised morality. Euripides favours Medea;
so does the Chorus; so does the plot. So strong is her passion,
so conscious is she of her own moral rectitude, so magnanimous
is her soul, that, if Aegeus had not come, she would have
carried out her plans, and if Aegeus had not sworn, she would
have done the same. But with her blood-stained hands she
would have driven into her heart the sword which had just
drained the life blood of her children.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Hippolytus’</span></h4>

<p>The scene of the <i>Hippolytus</i> is laid in Troizen, in S.E.
Argolis, the realm of Pittheus, the maternal grandfather of
Theseus, King of Athens. Thither Theseus has come, because,
says Euripides, he was sentenced to one year’s exile for the
slaying of Pallas and his sons. Aphrodite says<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But from Cecropia’s realm since Theseus fled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To expiate his pollution, with the blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Pallas’ sons distained, and with his queen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sailed for this coast, to punishment of exile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Submitting for one year.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Now Pausanias informs us<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> that ‘justifiable homicide was
the plea of Theseus when he was acquitted for killing Pallas
and his sons.’ We have pointed out<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> that Pallas and his
sons were slain in a civil war in Attica. As they were
technically rebels, and unjust aggressors, seeking to dethrone
Aegeus (the father of Theseus), who was the reigning monarch,
it was quite natural that from one point of view the act of
Theseus should have been morally regarded as justifiable
homicide. It would not have required a court of justice to
have established the validity of such a plea. Had not Eteocles
been automatically ‘acquitted’ for the slaying of Polyneices?
But why does Euripides speak of a sentence of one year’s
exile? This penalty in relation to kin-slaying (Pallas was
a brother of Aegeus) can only have one meaning. Plato
assures us<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> that if a kinsman slays a kinsman in a passion,
and if the deceased before he expires shall have ‘forgiven’
him and absolved him from blood-guiltiness, the deed shall
be regarded as involuntary homicide for which the normal
penalty was one year’s exile. To explain this reference in
Euripides, therefore, Theseus must be conceived as guilty of
extenuated kin-slaying which was ‘forgiven.’ But we are
nowhere told that the Pallantidae forgave their slayer! We
have said<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> that there was a legal affinity between the conceptions
of justifiable and of extenuated slaying. Yet the
two kinds of homicide were never identified, and it would be
all the more difficult to identify them when the deed concerned
a King of Athens. Hence we must suppose either (1) that
Euripides has here abandoned the tradition mentioned by
Pausanias, or (2) that the legal aspect of the slaying of the
Pallantidae had become confused in the legends, before
Euripides, with the legal aspect of some other deed of blood
with which the name of Theseus was associated.</p>

<p>During the sojourn of Theseus at Troizen, where his son
Hippolytus was being brought up, Phaedra, the second wife
of Theseus, sought to seduce into adulterous intercourse her
step-son, Hippolytus. Euripides represents Hippolytus as
an Orphic votary,<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and we will condone the anachronism<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
because it emphasises the probability of Hippolytus’ repudiation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
of Phaedra’s suggestions. Phaedra, in shame and anger, committed
suicide,<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but in revenge for the puritan’s rejection
of her love, she left behind her a letter in which she accused
Hippolytus of forcible violation.<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Such an accusation,
followed by suicide, would be sufficient to convict Hippolytus
in either ancient or modern times. It would have convicted
him of attempting an ‘indecent assault,’ and of attempted
adultery. But would it have convicted him of having caused
the death of Phaedra? Theseus believed him guilty of all
these crimes, and decided to banish him from Troizen, pronouncing
against him, in addition, a virulent curse which,
in the religious atmosphere of the ancient world, was as
dangerous to the life of Hippolytus as the σήματα λυγρά were
which were sent, in analogous circumstances, by Proitus to the
King of Lydia, in the legend of Bellerophon.<a id="FNanchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> He says<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">O Neptune, O my sire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since thou hast firmly promised that thou thrice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wouldst grant me what I prayed for, now fulfil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One vow, and slay my son, nor let him ’scape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This single day, if thou with me design</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ratify the compact thou hast made....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moreover I will drive him from the land:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For of these twofold fates, or this or that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must smite him: Neptune, when he hears my curses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will plunge the miscreant to the shades of hell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Else, cast forth from this region, and ordained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wander in some foreign land, a life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the profoundest misery shall he drag.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The crimes which Theseus attributes to Hippolytus are
so many and so various that it is impossible to connect this
penalty of banishment with the homicidal aspect of Phaedra’s
death. The penalty is too severe, as his action in causing
Phaedra’s death could hardly have been regarded even as
manslaughter.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that Hippolytus was banished from Athens
as well as from Troizen.<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> After leaving Troizen, as he was
travelling along the coast, he was assailed by a sea-monster
which was sent by Poseidon, within sight of the Scironian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
rocks<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> (this point, we shall see, is important for the correct
analysis of the legend): the horses took fright, and Hippolytus
was dragged behind the chariot until he was mortally
injured. He was brought back to Theseus; and as Artemis
miraculously revealed to Theseus his innocence of the crime
which had been alleged against him, the father and the son
became reconciled; and, before he died, Hippolytus absolved
his father from the guilt of blood.<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Thus the play ends.</p>

<p>We have said<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> that in early Greece, and even amongst the
Achaean caste, adultery was not punishable by death. Hence
the curse of Theseus renders him liable to blood-guilt. He
‘contrives’ death, he is αἴτιος φόνου,<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> even if he does not
actually slay Hippolytus. He confesses his guilt in the closing
scene. Now the ‘forgiveness’ of a dying kinsman did not
absolve the slayer from all punishment. He had still, in
historical Greece, to endure a penalty of one year’s exile from
his home-land. Is it not strange, therefore, that in this play
Theseus suffers no punishment for the death of Hippolytus?
Troizen was reputed to have been the birth-place of Theseus;
Athens was the birth-place of Hippolytus. Euripides remembers
the latter fact when he represents the exiled Hippolytus
as debarred from Athens. But he forgets the former
fact when he makes Troizen a place of exile for Theseus!
Pausanias says<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> that Theseus went to Troizen to be purified
for the slaying of Pallas and his sons, and that at Troizen
Phaedra accomplished the death of Hippolytus. Moreover,
Pausanias tells us<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> that over the royal portico of the
Athenian Prytaneum there was an earthenware statue which
represented Theseus in the act of hurling into the sea a certain
brigand named Sciron. For Euripides, Sciron is the name
of a sea boulder in the Saronic gulf. But Plutarch assures<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
us that Sciron was a kinsman of Theseus, that Theseus slew
him, and that as an atonement he instituted the sacred
Isthmian games!</p>

<p>It seems obvious that Euripides has either adopted an
eclectic attitude to these various legends of Theseus, or that
they had become ‘fused’ before his time. But he is not
concerned with legal accuracy or consistency, so much as with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
the construction of an intelligible plot of intense human interest.
To Euripides it must have appeared improbable that the
temporary sojourn of Theseus at Troizen was connected, as
Pausanias alleges, with purgation rites, since these rites would
normally have been performed at Athens. Moreover, the
brief period of time which such rites would have necessitated
does not afford a sufficient explanation of his ‘exile’ for the
space of one year. Again, it was absolutely necessary to
suppose that Theseus returned to Athens. But, for this, it
was necessary to assume that he was ‘forgiven’ by Hippolytus
whom he, directly and immediately, and Phaedra indirectly,<a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
caused to be killed. But we have not yet discovered
the secret of that one year’s sojourn at Troizen. We
believe that it is in the legend of Sciron, which Euripides
ignores, that we must seek the real origin of the tradition
concerning a ‘forgiveness’ and a period of one year’s exile,
in the life of Theseus. We have already<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> pointed out how
closely these two ideas may be correlated. We suggest that
the real legends of Theseus presented some such facts as the
following:</p>

<p>1. Theseus slew Pallas and his sons, was acquitted by the
Delphinium court,<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and was purged at Athens.</p>

<p>2. Phaedra, not Theseus, caused the death of Hippolytus.<a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>3. Theseus slew a kinsman,<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> named Sciron, in Attica,
but Sciron, before dying, forgave his slayer. Theseus therefore
went into exile for one year—not to Troizen—but to the
Isthmus where he instituted a sacred festival. He could not
have gone into exile to Troizen, for this realm belonged to him
(since he was the grandson of Pittheus<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>), and in Euripides
he claims the right to banish Hippolytus from Troizen.<a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
He was certainly a citizen of Troizen since in legend he was
born there.</p>

<p>We must suppose, therefore, according to this hypothesis,
either that Euripides selected different elements from these
legends and joined them together, or that they had been
confused in some one legend before his time. In this fusion
the forgiveness was shifted from Sciron to Hippolytus. Theseus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
was conceived as the cause of Hippolytus’ death; Sciron was
ignored and the slaying of Pallas was regarded as extenuated
but not as justifiable homicide.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Ion’</span></h4>

<p>The most important incident in the <i>Ion</i> is the attempted
murder (βούλευσις) of Ion, the eponymous ancestor of the
Ionians, by his mother Creusa, who does not know that he
is her son. Thus we meet once more a homicide problem
forming the basis of a drama, and a solution of that problem
which requires for its intelligibility the application of homicide-law.
Euripides is deliberately pandering to Athenian national
pride when he represents Ion, by repute the son of Xuthus,
as really the son of Apollo and Creusa.<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> In the temple of
Delphi he is reared as a minister of the god. Creusa has
almost forgotten the issue of her ancient amour, and by a
tragic irony comes with Xuthus to Delphi, to consult Apollo
as to the causes of her childlessness. Apollo informs Xuthus
that he will give him a son and heir, and Xuthus is led to believe
that his newly found ‘son,’ Ion, is the offspring of some
intrigue of his youth. When Creusa hears about this
‘stranger,’ she regards him with hostile feelings, and decides
to kill him by poison. In this design, however, she does not
succeed. Have we here, then, a ‘plot to kill’ or attempted
murder? The legal essence of the former, we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
is the realisation of the plot. Therefore, the guilt of Creusa
is that of attempted murder or βούλευσις. No one except
Apollo is supposed to be aware until the end of the play of the
real relationship which exists between Ion and Creusa. Hence,
we have here a suggestion of an act which, like that of
Oedipus, is objectively related to kin-slaying, but which, subjectively,
must be regarded as ordinary ‘attempted murder.’
We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> that in early Greece attempts to kill and
actual slayings were accorded equal punishment. But we
find in the <i>Ion</i> that Creusa is not punished at all! The
explanation of this problem is the main object of our present
inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span></p>

<p>When the attempted murder of a minister of Apollo is
discovered and reported, the whole civic machinery of the
Delphian State is put in motion.<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> A court is held at which
Ion is the accuser. He charges his mother with attempted
murder, but there is a subtle suggestion of the additional
guilt of attempted sacrilege. This court of Delphian nobles
condemns Creusa to death. Creusa’s servant says<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">The Chorus recommend Creusa to take refuge in a sanctuary.<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>

assurance that while she remains in the sanctuary she cannot
be slain.<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> But Ion, who by a tragic irony leads the executioners,
leaves no doubt that her refuge will not avail her.
He says<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Creusa in the ensuing dialogue advances a plea of justification.
She argues that if Ion came to Athens, sooner or later
he would have slain her through dynastic rivalry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Lest I should perish if your life was spared.<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But this was also the plea of Eurystheus when he sought the lives
of the Heracleidae. In Greek law the plea has no validity.
Ion commands his mother to leave the altar,<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> saying</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">For thy attempt to slay me?<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At this critical moment the Pythian priestess intervenes, and
requests Ion to desist. She holds that the attempt of Creusa
was mitigated by ‘passion’—and that therefore she did not
deserve to die. She says<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wives with inveterate hatred ever view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their husbands’ sons sprung from another bed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus does Apollo override the verdict of his priests! But he
goes farther. Creusa, according to the oracular interpretation
of her act, was guilty of an ‘extenuated’ attempt to kill,
and should therefore in strict law<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> have been punished by a
penalty of temporary exile. Yet she is permitted to return
forthwith to Athens, her native country! In the following
verses Ion is urged to ‘forgive’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Banish from thy soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This rancour, now the temple thou art leaving,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on thy journey to thy native land.<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But we have not yet rendered the <i>dénouement</i> legally intelligible.
We think that it can only be explained by one hypothesis,
namely, by assuming that Apollo takes upon himself the
responsibility for Creusa’s act. It was he who, by concealing
the true facts, had provoked Creusa to attempted murder.
It was he, therefore, who must take the blame. We have
seen that there is no doubt that otherwise Creusa would have
suffered death. That penalty is an archaic one, being based,
as we think, on the notion of the absence of discrimination in
early Greece between degrees of homicide-guilt. In the more
subtle analysis of Apollo we may see perhaps a suggestion of
Euripides as to the evolution of such distinctions, which
characterised the historical period. But it is possible that such
distinctions existed in Pelasgian groups, though not in Achaean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
or quasi-Achaean societies. If there is anything legally improbable
in this legend, it is obscured by the dramatic interest
which attaches to the recognition scene between the mother
and the son. Moreover Euripides and therefore the legend
which he follows were compelled to indicate the important
fact that Creusa <i>did</i> return with Ion to Athens, and that the
glorious mother of the Ionian race had not been stained by
the guilt of kindred bloodshed.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Andromache’</span></h4>

<p>In the <i>Andromache</i> there are two events of a homicidal
character which we must discuss: (1) the attempted murder
of Andromache, who was then a war-captive in the home of
Neoptolemus, and that of her son, by Hermione, the wife of
Neoptolemus, and by her father Menelaus: (2) the slaying of
Neoptolemus, at Delphi, by the Apolline priests and magistrates
on a false charge of sacrilege which was urged against him by
Orestes. The first event is clearly a case of attempted murder,
because the plot failed to materialise owing to the arrival of
Peleus. The second event is more difficult to define. Objectively,
it points to the execution of a normal penalty for
an alleged sacrilegious attempt to despoil the temple and for
a previous actual spoliation: but, subjectively, Orestes was
guilty of contriving the death of Neoptolemus, and he
advances, in private, a sham plea of justification, when he says
that he regards Neoptolemus, who had married Hermione,
his own fiancée, as a virtual adulterer.<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> From the words
which are addressed by Thetis to Peleus at the end of the play,<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
we may infer that the plot of Orestes was viewed with disapproval
by the gods. But, legally, he must escape punishment
because the actual slayers could plead sufficient justification,
and his private motives were not publicly proclaimed.
Let us give some details of both episodes. Hermione, when
her attempt to kill is discovered and frustrated, meditates
suicide, because, we are told, she fears that her husband will
slay her or send her into exile. Thus, a nurse in Hermione’s
service says<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Within these doors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hermione, my mistress, by her sire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forsaken, and grown conscious of the guilt</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Is her affliction, and she now confesses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That she has done amiss.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this passage death appears as the archaic penalty for
attempted murder. If Neoptolemus, the husband of Hermione,
permits an option of exile, it is perhaps because such an option
was permitted for actual murder in historical times, and the
penalties were supposed to have been identical, in cases of
attempted and of actual murder, in prehistoric days. It is
also possible to explain the option by reference to the fact
that Andromache was a captive and that therefore her master
had the right to forgo the full penalty. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
that the Achaeans did not discriminate between voluntary
and involuntary homicide, and we may regard the reference
to this penalty here as a case of historical archaising, which
attributed to the Achaean Neoptolemus an ignorance of the
distinction between attempted murder and actual murder.
But we may also suppose that there was a legend which
originally contained all these details and retained them as an
unadulterated tradition down the ages. In historical times
attempted slaying could not have been punished by a more
severe penalty than that of exile, the duration of which
depended perhaps on some form of ‘appeasement.’ That
such was the historical penalty may be inferred from the fact
that the Palladium court tried such cases in the time of
Aristotle and, we think, from Solon’s time onwards.<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> When
the ‘attempt’ (βούλευσις) resulted in actual wounding or in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
physical injury, as in cases of attempted poisoning, the case
was probably<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> tried by the Areopagus, and the sentence was
perpetual exile without confiscation of property.<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In this
play, however, as in the <i>Ion</i>, the attempted murder of Andromache
was unpunished; Neoptolemus, the natural punitive
agent, did not live to hear of the attempt. Andromache
herself warned Menelaus that the people of the district would
put him and Hermione on trial and punish them. She says<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Menelaus, be it now supposed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I by thy daughter am already slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twill be impossible for her to ’scape</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the pollution ruthless murder brings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou, too, by many tongues wilt be accused<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this vile deed, with her will they confound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee, the abettor.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Do we not seem to have here a legend which evolved? First
of all we have private vengeance. Everything depends on
Neoptolemus. Then pollution enters the story and the people
have a religious interest in homicide. Yet the main fact could
not be got rid of, namely that Hermione escaped punishment.
If Euripides is archaising, could he not have been consistent?
Or is he thinking of that vaguely defined post-Homeric age
in which the conception of murder as a pollution existed, but
in which homicide is still, as amongst the Hebrews, a matter
for the avenger of blood? But why, then, does he mention
the people? Is he thinking of the pressure of public opinion,
such as was already gathering in Achaean times? Andromache
seems to take a different view from that of Hermione.
The issue of the plot confirms Hermione’s outlook, which is
Achaean. Is it not more natural to suppose that an Achaean
story became partially ‘Apollinised’ in later times than to
suppose that Euripides gives us two different archaisms side
by side?</p>

<p>Andromache’s attack on Spartan homicide becomes intelligible
if we remember the anti-Spartan sentiments of the
democrat Euripides. ‘Is not murder abundant at Sparta?’
asks Andromache.<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> When, we ask, was it abundant?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
Is this statement merely a retort to Hermione’s assertion that
murder was common in barbarian Troy?<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Or is Euripides
deliberately asserting that Sparta was inferior even to barbarians?
According to the latter hypothesis we must assume
that he is speaking of historical Sparta, and his opinions are
to be attributed to anti-Spartan prejudice.<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In the second homicide episode of this drama, Neoptolemus
is slain at Delphi. Orestes who plots and in part executes
his death escapes all punishment, for reasons which we have
already indicated. The Delphians who are prepared, in the
<i>Ion</i>, to condemn to death a person guilty of attempted murder,
are here themselves engaged in slaying a visitor to their temple.
But Neoptolemus was an enemy. He has already despoiled
the temple. His life is therefore forfeit. To slay him was,
like the projected execution of Creusa, a just revenge. Yet
Fate has dealt harshly with Neoptolemus. He now visits
the temple not to despoil it, as Orestes falsely alleges, but to
make atonement for a previous offence which he had committed
against Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Despite the false evidence of Orestes,
Apollo, the prophet who knows all things, should have intervened.
Thus the messenger utters a criticism which suggests
the sentiments of Euripides and of fifth-century Athens<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Thus Phoebus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who prophesies to others, mighty King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And deals out justice to the admiring world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath on Achilles’ son revenged himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And like some worthless human foe, revived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An ancient grudge: how then can he be wise?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thetis declares that the death of Neoptolemus is a disgrace
to the Delphians and, is for Orestes, a murderous crime.<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Though slain on grounds of sacrilege, Neoptolemus is buried
near the shrine of Phoebus!<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The existence of such a tomb
at Delphi would naturally have begotten the story of his death
there: the fact that Hermione was, in one legend, the wife
of Orestes, in another the wife of Neoptolemus, and the close
connexion of Orestes with Delphi in post-Homeric story, may
explain his association with the death of Neoptolemus. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
the murderous plot which is here attributed to Orestes we
believe to be Euripidean. It has no proper sequel: it does
not harmonise with anything antecedent or subsequent: it is
just a novel, thrilling episode introduced by Euripides to give
an artistic interest to an otherwise dull and lifeless drama.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Hecuba’</span></h4>

<p>A deed of blood and its avenging forms the subject of the
<i>Hecuba</i>. The scene is laid at Troy and the atmosphere is predominantly
Homeric. Polymestor, King of Thrace, having
consented to act as the guardian and protector of Polydorus,
the son of Priam, King of Troy, murdered his ward and cast
his body unburied on the sea-shore. The mode of vengeance
which is put in force against Polymestor is peculiarly archaic.
The avengers are exclusively women, and are led by Hecuba,
the mother of Polydorus. The punishment which is exacted
is not the death or the exile of Polymestor, but the death
of his two sons, and the destruction of his eyes. Here we
have an instance of physical torture such as was prohibited
by a law of Dracon<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in the case of a convicted murderer
caught <i>en rupture de ban</i>. We have also an instance of
hereditary punishment which Greek law had abolished for
homicide in the seventh century, and had retained for treason
alone in the historical era,<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> in the form of a civic degradation
of the traitor’s posterity. Polymestor has no consciousness of
guilt after the slaying of Polydorus, as he regards his act as
justified in political self-defence, and therefore he proceeds
to avenge himself on Hecuba and the Trojan women whom he
now regards as the murderers of his children. At this stage
Agamemnon is requested by Hecuba to act as an arbitrator.<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
In his presence Polymestor says<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Chorus, however, imply that Polymestor has been justly
punished<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">That the severest punishments await.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This passage suggests that the poet is reproducing an archaic
atmosphere. Now the Achaeans, we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> ordinarily
held no trials for homicide. The pleadings before Agamemnon,
which we find here, do not, strictly speaking, constitute such
a trial. We have seen<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> that the Achaeans recognised a
distinction between murder and just revenge. Athene upholds
that distinction in the <i>Odyssey</i>. Agamemnon upholds that
distinction here. He decides in favour of Hecuba, saying to
Polymestor<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

transmitted without adulteration, or is Euripides correctly
archaising from his general knowledge of Achaean procedure
as revealed by Homer? The former alternative seems to us
the more probable in view of the consistently archaic atmosphere
of this play. There is no reference to homicide as a
‘pollution,’ to purgation, to Apollo, to State trial. A certain
degree of divine anger against Polymestor is indicated, but
this was caused by the violation of hospitality and by the act
of deprivation of burial, both of which acts are religious offences
in Homer. Hecuba says to the Chorus<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the scepticism of Talthybius regarding the existence of
the gods, we have an anachronism which is strictly applicable
only to the rationalists of fifth-century Athens. The comparative
indifference of the Achaeans to religion left the road
open for this anachronism on the part of Euripides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>When the son of Achilles is sacrificing Polyxena at the tomb
of Achilles, he says to the spirit of Achilles<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Son of Peleus,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of this pure virgin whom to thee all Greece</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I devote.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For this placation of the dead by human sacrifice we have
perhaps a precedent in the sacrifice by Achilles of twelve
Trojan youths to the shade of Patroclus. But the suggestion
that the dead man came to the tomb to drink the blood offering
indicates a fusion of Pelasgian and Achaean beliefs such as
Ridgeway assumes to have taken place before the time of
Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Already in the <i>Odyssey</i>, however, there is evidence
of the tendency to a fusion of ritual and beliefs, which
reached maturity before the historical period.<a id="FNanchor_1884b" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Such words
as Euripides here attributes to Achilles could never have been
spoken by the Homeric Achilles. For the Achaeans, the dead,
once they were buried, could never leave Hades, and they
did not, like Pelasgian ghosts, drink blood offerings at the
tomb. This, then, is an anachronism, which was perhaps
derived from a misinterpretation by Euripides of the Nekuia
in the <i>Odyssey</i>. Hecuba naturally objects to the sacrifice
of her daughter,<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> but incidentally she objects to human
sacrifice in general, save in the case of a real enemy. Polyxena,
she argues, was not an enemy to Achilles. His ghost therefore
could not be placated by her sacrifice. This attitude of
Hecuba suggests that a post-Homeric Thracian legend contained
a reference to a barbarous blood-thirst on the part of
the dead, which we have attributed to the Hesiodic age of
chaos. Euripides elsewhere attributes the sacrifice of Polyxena
to the expressed desire of the ghost of Achilles!<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> We cannot
be certain whether a post-Homeric legend embodied these
conceptions, or whether Euripides invented them in his desire
to add to the horrors of the story another grim idea.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Bacchae’</span></h4>

<p>On the first introduction, into Thebes, of the worship of
Bacchus, or of what may be termed the orgiastic cult of
Dionysus, Pentheus, the reigning King, opposed the new
religion, declared Bacchus an impostor,<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> and threatened
him with death.<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Hence the chorus of Bacchanals, inspired
with prophetic foresight, approve in advance the death of
Pentheus whom they regard as an enemy or a traitor.<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> By
a tragic irony, Agave, the mother of Pentheus, who has joined
the Bacchic worshippers and is mesmerised by Bacchic influence,
is the actual perpetrator of the death of Pentheus. She is
deluded by Bacchic frenzy into believing that she is slaying
a lion, and returns to Thebes carrying what she believes to be
a lion’s head. She says<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye that within the high-towered Theban city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dwell, come and gaze ye all upon our prey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mighty beast by Cadmus’ daughter ta’en;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor with Thessalian sharp-pointed javelins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor nets, but with the white and delicate palms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of our own hands. Go ye and make your boast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trusting to the spear-maker’s useless craft:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We with these hands have ta’en our prey, and rent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mangled limbs of this grim beast asunder.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is mine aged sire? Let him draw near!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And where is my son Pentheus? Let him mount</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the broad stairs that rise before our house;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the triglyph nail this lion’s head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I have brought him from our splendid chase.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Her position, then, differs from that of Ajax,<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> in that the deed
really takes place and that she did not intend it. The act is,
we shall find, analogous to, but less culpable than, that of
Oedipus when he slew his father.</p>

<p>Cadmus, father of Agave, refers the ultimate guilt to
Bacchus<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Justly—too justly hath King Bromius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Destroyed us, fatal kindred to our house.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Agave adopts a similar attitude when she realises the nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
of the deed which she has wrought.<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But she cannot escape
all punishment. At the end of the play Dionysus propounds
an oracle of Zeus which declares<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> that Cadmus shall become
a dragon, and his wife Harmonia shall become a serpent, but
that they will nevertheless conquer many barbarian cities
and will be borne ultimately to the land of the blessed gods.
Yet they must leave Thebes now because of their impious
attitude to Dionysus! Is this decree an instance of ‘collective’
punishment? Is it necessary that the entire family
of Cadmus should suffer for the impiety of Pentheus which he
has already atoned for by an ignominious death? It may be
an explanation of this obscure punishment to say that it is
collective. But what shall we say of Agave? She also has
to leave Thebes. Is her exile to be regarded as a penalty for
‘impiety’ in regard to Dionysus? Surely she has already
been sufficiently pious and to her cost! She was actually one
of the Bacchic worshippers, in the play. Moreover, in going
into exile she bids farewell to her father!<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> They are all
sent into exile together, yet she cannot go with her father.<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Surely, if impiety were the offence, and the penalty were collective
exile, all the offenders could have gone in conjunction.
Why is Agave exiled, then, if she is condemned to separate
exile? We suggest that this penalty is inflicted because of
kin-slaying in religious frenzy, that is to say, in legal language,
‘in a passion.’ Plato assures us<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> that kin-slaying extenuated
by passion prohibited the slayer from any further intercourse
with her family. ‘If a father or mother in a passion
kill their son or daughter by blows or in any other violent
manner ... let them remain in exile for three years and on
returning let the husband be divorced from the wife and the
wife from the husband, and let them never afterwards beget
children together nor dwell in fellowship with those whom
they have deprived of child or brother, or have a share in their
sacred rites.’ But Agave goes into exile with her sisters
Autonoe and Ino, who had shared in the death of Pentheus.
They too are separated from Cadmus. The reason is perhaps
that Cadmus symbolises the domestic religion of their home.
From him, as from their home, they must be exiled for ever.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Alcestis’</span></h4>

<p>Neither the <i>Alcestis</i> nor the other two plays of Euripides
which remain for discussion are of very much importance
from the point of view of homicide-law. In the prologue<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
Apollo tells how he slew the Cyclops who forged the thunder-bolt
by which Zeus slew Aesculapius, Apollo’s son, and how in
consequence he went into bondage with Admetus of Pherae
for a period of one year. Thus Zeus plots the death of his
grandson and punishes his son for avenging it! The reason
is that Zeus regards the death of Aesculapius as justified,
and therefore, as Apollo’s vengeance is unjust, he must be
punished. The penalty of bondage which is here referred to
may be the Pelasgian servitude which we have discussed in
an early part of this work,<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> or it may be a form of that
same penalty which was retained under the pollution-system,
in pre-Draconian days when it was indispensably connected
with exile. There is here, however, no reference to pollution
or to purgation. Apollo was purified for slaying the
Python<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> but not for the slaying of the Cyclops! We cannot
apply to the Olympian Apollo the laws which were made for
mortal men. Apollo, unlike Hercules, could not be conceived
as a man. It was from Olympus, the abode of the Olympian
gods, that he was banished. The obvious motive for the legend
is the association of Apollo with Admetus. Some reason had
to be assigned for this ‘exile’ of Apollo. We may suppose that
a deed of homicide was invented to explain this ‘exile,’ but that
its details were not worked out. The only real importance of
such a legend is that it affords a certain amount of evidence for
the existence of servitude as a homicide-penalty in early Greece.</p>

<p>Admetus is permitted by the Fates to live if he can find a
substitute. His wife Alcestis voluntarily dies in his stead.
Was her death attributable to Admetus? Was he her
murderer? His father, Pheres, seems to think so!<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">As Hercules, in this play, raises to life the dead Alcestis, we
are freed from the necessity of discussing the legal aspects of
such a problem. The whole plot of this play belongs to the
supernatural rather than to the natural order. The murder
laws of Greece made no provision for such contingencies.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Troades’</span></h4>

<p>In the <i>Troades</i> Cassandra foresees the murder of Agamemnon
and the vengeance of Orestes, and connects these tragic misfortunes
with the woes which were brought by the Atreidae
upon the house of Priam. Aeschylus has a suggestion of this
sentiment in the <i>Agamemnon</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> To represent Clytaemnestra
and Orestes as mere instruments in the hands of Destiny
may be religiously orthodox to a superstitious people, especially
in the Dark Ages of prehistoric Greece, but it has no legal
validity. Such sentiments are really antagonistic to legal
sanctions. Applied to Achaeans, they are, we think,
anachronistic. Murder is distinct from war, and murder is
not conceived as begetting murder, in the course of Destiny,
until post-Homeric times. In the decision of the Greeks to
slay Astyanax, the son of Andromache, as a reprisal for the
adultery of Paris,<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> we see an instance of hyper-vengeance,
which is characteristic of hostile belligerents. We cannot infer
that amongst the Achaeans the punishment for adultery was
more severe than amongst the Pelasgians.<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Astyanax was
not an adulterer! His punishment was a reprisal, and has
therefore no legal significance. Talthybius refers to a strange
proposal on the part of the Greeks, namely a proposal to set
up a spear in the tomb of Astyanax.<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Now this spear is
a symbol of future vengeance. It is strange that such a
symbol should have been set up by the party who deserve and
anticipate punishment. Moreover, we have seen<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> that this
custom was probably post-Homeric. The Achaeans did not
credit their dead spirits, after burial, with any local habitation
in the tomb or with any effective desire for vengeance.
Here, the suggestion is clearly intended by Talthybius, and
possibly by Euripides, to bring some slight comfort to Hecuba,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
the bereaved mother. We have referred to a passage in Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
in which a plaintiff, who was debarred from a
prosecution for bloodshed, because of his not having been
akin in blood to the deceased, was advised by the Exegetae
to carry a spear at the funeral. It was therefore rather a
cruel piece of irony for Euripides to suggest that by the setting
up of this symbol—which had come, in historical times, to
indicate the absence of avengers—the Greeks intended to
express at once to Hecuba the hope of retaliation and to themselves
the hope of immunity from vengeance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The ‘Helen’</span></h4>

<p>The scene of the <i>Helen</i> is laid in Egypt. We are told
that the ubiquitous Helen escapes with Menelaus from Egypt,
having deceived by a stratagem her amorous protector,
Theoclymenus. She was aided in her plans by Theonoe,
the sister of Theoclymenus, and he, therefore, in the anger
of disappointed passion, proceeded to slay his sister. The
Dioscuri intervened in time to prevent the realisation of his
purpose, and all ends happily! Technically, Theoclymenus
is guilty of attempted kin-slaying, but the poet leads us to
suppose that an ungovernable fit of passion would, in such a
case, be regarded as a complete extenuation. We may infer
from the words of the Chorus that the slaying of one’s kindred
was regarded with horror by races which were outside Greece.
The Chorus will not permit the death of Theonoe, even though
they intervene at their peril. They say to Theoclymenus<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Kill me. Your sister you with my consent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall never slay: I rather would yield up</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To generous servants for their lords to die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Euripides also makes the barbarian Thoas, King of the
Tauric Chersonese, gasp with horror when Iphigeneia, the
priestess of Artemis, informs him of the arrival of the matricide
Orestes. When Iphigeneia says<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">O Phoebus! This hath no barbarian dared.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Euripides, then, did not believe that the conception of kin-slaying
as a horrible and revolting act was an exclusively
Grecian sentiment. When therefore in the <i>Andromache</i> he
makes Hermione say<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Prohibits: introduce not among us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such crimes....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we may attribute such an assertion to a mind inflamed with
the jealousy which a wife feels towards a concubine rather than
suppose Euripides not to have known that the horror of kin-slaying
is an aboriginal universal sentiment of the human race
when once it has abandoned the cave of the cannibal.</p>

<p class="tb">We have now concluded our inquiry into the problem of
blood-vengeance in Attic tragedy. Nothing has been revealed
by this inquiry which is in conflict with the hypotheses which
we have sought to establish in this work, as to the various
systems of blood-vengeance which existed in Greece, from
Pelasgian times to the age of the orators. While Attic tragedy
does not in itself contribute anything to our knowledge of
these various systems, there can be little doubt that an attempt,
however imperfect, to investigate the origin and nature of
these systems is indispensable for a proper appreciation of
these dramatic masterpieces. If our analysis of blood-vengeance
in the works of the three great Attic tragedians
has not, in many cases, succeeded in establishing definite
clear-cut conclusions, this, we hope, will be attributed to the
intrinsic difficulty and obscurity of the subject. We can never
be quite certain whether any particular drama gives us (<i>a</i>) an
antique unadulterated legend; or (<i>b</i>) an antique legend which
in course of evolution has taken on new forms without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
regard to the consistency or the historicity of the tradition;
or (<i>c</i>) whether the drama is based upon a late invention which
owing to skilful archaising takes on the garb and appearance
of an antique story, betraying perhaps, here and there, by its
anachronisms, the mind and atmosphere of its creator. It
so happens that the attitude to homicide or to religion which
the Achaeans reveal was also taken up by many individual
Athenians of the Periclean age. Thus the indifference to
the gods which Sophocles attributes to Ajax was common
to Achaeans and to many Periclean Athenians. So the
conception of homicide as a matter for ‘private settlement’
which is found in Demosthenes, and the survival, in outlying
places, such as Macedonia, of family vendettas, fierce and lawless,
would have suggested to the mind of the dramatist that
there was no very wide gulf between the primitive and the
historical Greeks. Such a fact almost invites anachronisms.
Nevertheless, we frequently find in dramatic legends an
atmosphere so antique, so unlike that of fifth-century Athens,
that we may assume, as the most probable hypothesis, that
these legends are not inventions, but have behind them a long
and, often, a chequered past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONCLUSION"><span class="smcap">General Conclusion</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Having now concluded our inquiry into the origin, the
nature, and the evolution of Greek systems of blood-vengeance,
it may be desirable to give here a brief synoptic summary of
the theories which we have sought to establish. Our summary
naturally falls into two sections: (A) chronological
and (B) literary.</p>

<p>(A) (1) From the earliest times there existed in Greece a
code of homicide-customs which is a well-known characteristic
of the tribal or ‘group’ system of primitive human society;
wergeld was the dominant penalty, and exile or death, or,
possibly, servitude were alternative penalties; there was regular
trial and collective control. We may call the system
‘private vengeance,’ but it was fundamentally different from
‘vendetta.’ This system has left only very slight traces of
its existence in extant Greek literary or inscriptional remains:
while it persisted in a suppressed or modified form all through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
the course of ancient Greek history, its presence was obscured
by other developments, social, religious, and political.</p>

<p>(2) Thus there was, in the first place, the Achaean
domination (say, 1300-1100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) which is the dominant
atmosphere of the Homeric poems; we have seen that
the Achaean system in regard to homicide made death the
normal penalty, but that this penalty could be avoided
in practice, though not in theory, by the flight of the slayer.
There was no regular or prescribed trial, but there existed
a kind of social etiquette or a potential military discipline
which established a general distinction between murder and
vengeance, and which, while omitting any nice points of discrimination
in estimating the degrees of guilt, nevertheless
prevented any wholesale system of vendetta.</p>

<p>(3) When in the ‘Hesiodic’ age (1000-750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) various
migrations and economic changes disturbed the peaceful operation
of clan-laws, and no form of control, either tribal or
military, could be said to exist in the greater part of Greece
(excluding, perhaps, the Attic State), then arose, as we
think, in its full vigour the barbarous vendetta system
which has left so marked a trace in Greek legends: then
rose to prominence the belief in ancestral curses, which
were held to fall upon children even in the fourth generation.
Then came into being the blood-thirst of the dead, the
mutilation of the murdered corpse, the deprivation of burial—all
the barbarisms of collective hereditary vendetta.</p>

<p>(4) Into this state of chaos there came, as it were, by the
foresight of the gods, in the seventh century, the ‘Apolline’
religious code. The murderer now becomes god-hated: he
is shunned by society: all men must rise in horror against
him, and if he is guilty they must either slay him or banish
him for ever. Courts must operate, for murder, if for nothing
else. The right of suppliants must be respected at least till
guilt is proved. Wergeld is abolished, but a minor appeasement
of the relatives is permitted after exile, for minor degrees
of guilt.</p>

<p>(5) Almost contemporaneously came the evolution of
the synoekised Greek State. A compromise between the old
and the new ideas produced the laws of Dracon and the
historical murder-codes of Greece. The State now takes over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
the execution, as well as the trial of homicides. The avenger
of blood gives place to the Public Executioner. Parricide
and kin-slaying are punishable with death. The property of
wilful murderers is confiscated to the State. Courts which at
first have general jurisdiction specialise in certain kinds of
homicide, and their specialised functions are stereotyped in
law. The personnel of these courts undergoes modifications
which keep pace, in the main, with the advance of democracy
to complete political power.</p>

<p>(B) (1) We have seen that the homicide references in Homer
can only be properly understood by assuming a predominance,
in legend or in the atmosphere of the poet, of the Achaean
system of vengeance, and the existence of faint but unmistakable
echoes of the Pelasgian wergeld system.</p>

<p>(2) Of the Hesiodic period the poems of Hesiod are the
only authentic evidence, and such evidence is obscure. We
may however supplement it indirectly by arguments from
survivals, and by the argument of ‘elimination.’</p>

<p>(3) Of the Apolline or historical system we need not
review the evidence which has been given at length in our
Second Book. This evidence has been examined and interpreted
by many modern scholars. We have indicated what
we considered the most probable interpretation of matters
which were open to doubt, especially when the solution of
the problem was important for the analysis of blood-vengeance
in Attic tragedy. We have sought to prove that Plato’s
homicide code should be regarded as an important and indispensable
contribution to the study of Greek homicide-law.
However difficult the analysis of the references to homicide
in Attic tragedy may have been, without Plato any such
analysis would have been impossible.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
